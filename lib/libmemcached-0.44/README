Hi!

So what is this? It is a library in C for connecting to memcached servers
(http://danga.com/memcached/). It is also a collection of utilities designed
to work with memcached.

memcat - Copy the value of a key to standard output
memflush - Flush the contents of your servers.
memrm - Remove a key(s) from the server.
memstat - Dump the stats of your servers to standard output
memslap - Load generation utility (benchmark!)

The utilities are beta quality at this point. The library is in production
in many locations (upwards to 1000+ nodes).

Want to contribute? If you write more then three good patches, then I will
just ask you to commit directly to the tree. I am happy to have additional
people work on this project. Please checkout README.FIRST. 

You will need a C99 compiler in order to compile this library. Currently we
actively support Linux, MacOSX, FreeBSD, and Solaris. A Windows port is
currently not supported, but one is listed on the homepage that is supported
by someone in the community.
