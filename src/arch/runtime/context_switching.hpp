/*
 * This is an alternative implementation where each context runs in a thread of
 * its own. The primary use case for this is to allow certain profiling tools
 * that would otherwise get confused by our artificial_stack switches to be used
 * with RethinkDB. Another use case is to ease porting RethinkDB to new
 * architectures in cases where performance doesn't matter much.
 *
 * Internally, one thread is created per threaded_stack_t. To be compatible
 * with the artificial_stack_t implementation, we simulate a fixed number of
 * "virtual threads" (up to MAX_THREADS) Each threaded_stack_t has an associated
 * virtual thread and only one threaded_stack_t can be active per virtual thread
 * at any time, which is enforced through a mutex per virtual thread and a
 * condition in each threaded_stack_t.
 *
 * A context switch then is simply notifying the condition on the threaded_stack_t
 * that should be swapped in and then making the previous context wait on its own
 * condition (there is some additional logic for handling virtual thread
 * switches and switching from/to the global context).
