// TODO: continue_on_thread() and call_later_on_this_thread are mostly obsolete because of
// coroutine-based thread switching.

// continue_on_thread() is used to send a message to another thread. If the 'thread' parameter is the
// thread that we are already on, then it returns 'true'; otherwise, it will cause the other
// thread's event loop to call msg->on_thread_switch().

// call_later_on_this_thread() will cause msg->on_thread_switch() to be called from the main event loop
// of the thread we are currently on. It's a bit of a hack.

/* TODO: It is common in the codebase right now to have code like this:

if (continue_on_thread(thread, msg)) call_later_on_this_thread(msg);

This is because originally clients would just call store_message_ordered() directly.
When continue_on_thread() was written, the code still assumed that the message's
callback would not be called before continue_on_thread() returned. Using
call_later_on_this_thread() is not ideal because it would be better to just
continue processing immediately if we are already on the correct thread, but
at the time it didn't seem worth rewriting it, so call_later_on_this_thread()
was added to make it easy to simulate the old semantics. */
