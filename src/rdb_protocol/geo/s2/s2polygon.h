// An S2Polygon is an S2Region object that represents a polygon.  A polygon
// consists of zero or more loops representing "shells" and "holes".  All
// loops should be oriented CCW, i.e. the shell or hole is on the left side of
// the loop.  Loops may be specified in any order.  A point is defined to be
// inside the polygon if it is contained by an odd number of loops.
//
// Polygons have the following restrictions:
//
//  - Loops may not cross, i.e. the boundary of a loop may not intersect
//    both the interior and exterior of any other loop.
//
//  - Loops may not share edges, i.e. if a loop contains an edge AB, then
//    no other loop may contain AB or BA.
//
//  - No loop may cover more than half the area of the sphere.  This ensures
//    that no loop properly contains the complement of any other loop, even
//    if the loops are from different polygons.  (Loops that represent exact
//    hemispheres are allowed.)
//
// Loops may share vertices, however no vertex may appear twice in a single
// loop (see s2loop.h).
