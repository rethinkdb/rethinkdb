// The S2 class is simply a namespace for constants and static utility
// functions related to spherical geometry, such as area calculations and edge
// intersection tests.  The name "S2" is derived from the mathematical symbol
// for the two-dimensional unit sphere (note that the "2" refers to the
// dimension of the surface, not the space it is embedded in).
//
// This class also defines a framework for decomposing the unit sphere into a
// hierarchy of "cells".  Each cell is a quadrilateral bounded by four
// geodesics.  The top level of the hierarchy is obtained by projecting the
// six faces of a cube onto the unit sphere, and lower levels are obtained by
// subdividing each cell into four children recursively.
//
// This class specifies the details of how the cube faces are projected onto
// the unit sphere.  This includes getting the face ordering and orientation
// correct so that sequentially increasing cell ids follow a continuous
// space-filling curve over the entire sphere, and defining the
// transformation from cell-space to cube-space in order to make the cells
// more uniform in size.
//
// This file also contains documentation of the various coordinate systems
// and conventions used.

// This class is not thread-safe for loops and objects that use loops.

  // About centroids:
  // ----------------
  //
  // There are several notions of the "centroid" of a triangle.  First, there
  //  // is the planar centroid, which is simply the centroid of the ordinary
  // (non-spherical) triangle defined by the three vertices.  Second, there is
  // the surface centroid, which is defined as the intersection of the three
  // medians of the spherical triangle.  It is possible to show that this
  // point is simply the planar centroid projected to the surface of the
  // sphere.  Finally, there is the true centroid (mass centroid), which is
  // defined as the area integral over the spherical triangle of (x,y,z)
  // divided by the triangle area.  This is the point that the triangle would
  // rotate around if it was spinning in empty space.
  //
  // The best centroid for most purposes is the true centroid.  Unlike the
  // planar and surface centroids, the true centroid behaves linearly as
  // regions are added or subtracted.  That is, if you split a triangle into
  // pieces and compute the average of their centroids (weighted by triangle
  // area), the result equals the centroid of the original triangle.  This is
  // not true of the other centroids.
  //
  // Also note that the surface centroid may be nowhere near the intuitive
  // "center" of a spherical triangle.  For example, consider the triangle
  // with vertices A=(1,eps,0), B=(0,0,1), C=(-1,eps,0) (a quarter-sphere).
  // The surface centroid of this triangle is at S=(0, 2*eps, 1), which is
  // within a distance of 2*eps of the vertex B.  Note that the median from A
  // (the segment connecting A to the midpoint of BC) passes through S, since
  // this is the shortest path connecting the two endpoints.  On the other
  // hand, the true centroid is at M=(0, 0.5, 0.5), which when projected onto
  // the surface is a much more reasonable interpretation of the "center" of
  // this triangle.

  // Return the centroid of the planar triangle ABC.  This can be normalized
  // to unit length to obtain the "surface centroid" of the corresponding
  // spherical triangle, i.e. the intersection of the three medians.  However,
  // note that for large spherical triangles the surface centroid may be
  // nowhere near the intuitive "center" (see example above).

                                S2Point const& c);

  // Returns the true centroid of the spherical triangle ABC multiplied by the
  // signed area of spherical triangle ABC.  The reasons for multiplying by

  ////////////////////////// S2Cell Decomposition /////////////////////////
  //
  // The following methods define the cube-to-sphere projection used by
  // the S2Cell decomposition.
  //
  // In the process of converting a latitude-longitude pair to a 64-bit cell
  // id, the following coordinate systems are used:
  //
  //  (id)
  //    An S2CellId is a 64-bit encoding of a face and a Hilbert curve position
  //    on that face.  The Hilbert curve position implicitly encodes both the
  //    position of a cell and its subdivision level (see s2cellid.h).
  //
  //  (face, i, j)
  //    Leaf-cell coordinates.  "i" and "j" are integers in the range
  //    [0,(2**30)-1] that identify a particular leaf cell on the given face.
  //    The (i, j) coordinate system is right-handed on each face, and the
  //    faces are oriented such that Hilbert curves connect continuously from
  //    one face to the next.
  //
  //  (face, s, t)
  //    Cell-space coordinates.  "s" and "t" are real numbers in the range
  //    [0,1] that identify a point on the given face.  For example, the point
  //    (s, t) = (0.5, 0.5) corresponds to the center of the top-level face
  //    cell.  This point is also a vertex of exactly four cells at each
  //    subdivision level greater than zero.
  //
  //  (face, si, ti)
  //    Discrete cell-space coordinates.  These are obtained by multiplying
  //    "s" and "t" by 2**31 and rounding to the nearest unsigned integer.
  //    Discrete coordinates lie in the range [0,2**31].  This coordinate
  //    system can represent the edge and center positions of all cells with
  //    no loss of precision (including non-leaf cells).
  //
  //  (face, u, v)
  //    Cube-space coordinates.  To make the cells at each level more uniform
  //    in size after they are projected onto the sphere, we apply apply a
  //    nonlinear transformation of the form u=f(s), v=f(t).  The (u, v)
  //    coordinates after this transformation give the actual coordinates on
  //    the cube face (modulo some 90 degree rotations) before it is projected
  //    onto the unit sphere.
  //
  //  (x, y, z)
  //    Direction vector (S2Point).  Direction vectors are not necessarily unit
  //    length, and are often chosen to be points on the biunit cube
  //    [-1,+1]x[-1,+1]x[-1,+1].  They can be be normalized to obtain the
  //    corresponding point on the unit sphere.
  //
  //  (lat, lng)
  //    Latitude and longitude (S2LatLng).  Latitudes must be between -90 and
  //    90 degrees inclusive, and longitudes must be between -180 and 180
  //    degrees inclusive.

// We have implemented three different projections from cell-space (s,t) to
// cube-space (u,v): linear, quadratic, and tangent.  They have the following
// tradeoffs:
//
//   Linear - This is the fastest transformation, but also produces the least
//   uniform cell sizes.  Cell areas vary by a factor of about 5.2, with the
//   largest cells at the center of each face and the smallest cells in
//   the corners.
//
//   Tangent - Transforming the coordinates via atan() makes the cell sizes
//   more uniform.  The areas vary by a maximum ratio of 1.4 as opposed to a
//   maximum ratio of 5.2.  However, each call to atan() is about as expensive
//   as all of the other calculations combined when converting from points to
//   cell ids, i.e. it reduces performance by a factor of 3.
//
//   Quadratic - This is an approximation of the tangent projection that
//   is much faster and produces cells that are almost as uniform in size.
//   It is about 3 times faster than the tangent projection for converting
//   cell ids to points or vice versa.  Cell areas vary by a maximum ratio of
//   about 2.1.
//
// Here is a table comparing the cell uniformity using each projection.  "Area
// ratio" is the maximum ratio over all subdivision levels of the largest cell
// area to the smallest cell area at that level, "edge ratio" is the maximum
// ratio of the longest edge of any cell to the shortest edge of any cell at
// the same level, and "diag ratio" is the ratio of the longest diagonal of
// any cell to the shortest diagonal of any cell at the same level.  "ToPoint"
// and "FromPoint" are the times in microseconds required to convert cell ids
// to and from points (unit vectors) respectively.  "ToPointRaw" is the time
// to convert to a non-unit-length vector, which is all that is needed for
// some purposes.
//
//               Area    Edge    Diag   ToPointRaw  ToPoint  FromPoint
//              Ratio   Ratio   Ratio             (microseconds)
// -------------------------------------------------------------------
// Linear:      5.200   2.117   2.959      0.020     0.087     0.085
// Tangent:     1.414   1.414   1.704      0.237     0.299     0.258

//
// The worst-case cell aspect ratios are about the same with all three
// projections.  The maximum ratio of the longest edge to the shortest edge
// within the same cell is about 1.4 and the maximum ratio of the diagonals
// within the same cell is about 1.7.
