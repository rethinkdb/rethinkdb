// This is a simple class for assembling polygons out of edges.  It requires
// that no two edges cross.  It can handle both directed and undirected edges,
// and optionally it can also remove duplicate edge pairs (consisting of two
// identical edges or an edge and its reverse edge).  This is useful for
// computing seamless unions of polygons that have been cut into pieces.
//
// Here are some of the situations this class was designed to handle:
//
// 1. Computing the union of disjoint polygons that may share part of their
//    boundaries.  For example, reassembling a lake that has been split into
//    two loops by a state boundary.
//
// 2. Constructing polygons from input data that does not follow S2
//    conventions, i.e. where loops may have repeated vertices, or distinct
//    loops may share edges, or shells and holes have opposite or unspecified
//    orientations.
//
// 3. Computing the symmetric difference of a set of polygons whose edges
//    intersect only at vertices.  This can be used to implement a limited
//    form of polygon intersection or subtraction as well as unions.
//
// 4. As a tool for implementing other polygon operations by generating a
//    collection of directed edges and then assembling them into loops.

  // is useful for computing the union of a collection of polygons whose
  // interiors are disjoint but whose boundaries may share some common edges
  // (e.g. computing the union of South Africa, Lesotho, and Swaziland).
  //
  // Note that for directed edges, a "duplicate edge pair" consists of an edge

  // not share edges.  Otherwise undirected_edges() should be specified.
  //
  // There are only two reasons to turn off xor_edges():
  //
  //  (1) AssemblePolygon() will be called, and you want to assert that there
  //      are no duplicate edge pairs in the input.
  //
  //  (2) AssembleLoops() will be called, and you want to keep abutting loops
  //      separate in the output rather than merging their regions together
  //      (e.g. assembling loops for Kansas City, KS and Kansas City, MO
  //      simultaneously).

  // Note that edges can move arbitrarily far if there is a long chain of
  // vertices in just the right places.
  //
  // You can turn off edge splicing by setting this value to zero.  This will

  // Note that the edge splice fraction must be less than sqrt(3)/2 in order to
  // avoid infinite loops in the merge algorithm.  The default value is very
  // close to this maximum and therefore results in the maximum amount of edge
  // splicing for a given vertex merge radius.
  //
  // The only reason to reduce the edge splice fraction is if you want to limit
  // changes in edge direction due to splicing.  The direction of an edge can
  // change by up to asin(edge_splice_fraction) due to each splice.  Thus by
  // default, edges are allowed to change direction by up to 60 degrees per
  // splice.  However, note that most direction changes are much smaller than

  // outside the vertex merge radius from one of the edge endpoints.
