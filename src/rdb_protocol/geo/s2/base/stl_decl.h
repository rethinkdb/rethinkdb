// DEPRECATED: This file is deprecated.  Do not use in new code.
// Be careful about removing from old code, though, because your
// header file might be included by higher-level code that is
// accidentally depending on this. This file has no impact in linux
// compilations; you can safely remove dependencies from linux code.
//
// Original file level comment:
//   In most .h files, we would rather include a declaration of an stl
//   rather than including the appropriate stl h file (which brings in
//   lots of crap).  For many STL classes this is ok (eg pair), but for
//   some it's really annoying.  We define those here, so you can
//   just include this file instead of having to deal with the annoyance.
//
//   Most of the annoyance, btw, has to do with the default allocator.
