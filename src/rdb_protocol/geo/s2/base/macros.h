// The arraysize(arr) macro returns the # of elements in an array arr.
// The expression is a compile-time constant, and therefore can be
// used in defining new arrays, for example.  If you use arraysize on
// a pointer by mistake, you will get a compile-time error.
//
// One caveat is that arraysize() doesn't accept any array of an
// anonymous type or a type defined inside a function.  In these rare
// cases, you have to use the unsafe ARRAYSIZE() macro below.  This is
// due to a limitation in C++'s template system.  The limitation might
// eventually be removed, but it hasn't happened yet.

// This template function declaration is used in defining arraysize.
// Note that the function doesn't need an implementation, as we only
// use its type.

// ARRAYSIZE performs essentially the same calculation as arraysize,
// but can be used on anonymous types or types defined inside
// functions.  It's less safe than arraysize as it accepts some
// (although not all) pointers.  Therefore, you should use arraysize
// whenever possible.
//
// The expression ARRAYSIZE(a) is a compile-time constant of type
// size_t.
//
// ARRAYSIZE catches a few type errors.  If you see a compiler error
//
//   "warning: division by zero in ..."
//
// when using ARRAYSIZE, you are (wrongfully) giving it a pointer.
// You should only use ARRAYSIZE on statically allocated arrays.
//
// The following comments are on the implementation details, and can
// be ignored by the users.
//
// ARRAYSIZE(arr) works by inspecting sizeof(arr) (the # of bytes in
// the array) and sizeof(*(arr)) (the # of bytes in one array
// element).  If the former is divisible by the latter, perhaps arr is
// indeed an array, in which case the division result is the # of
// elements in the array.  Otherwise, arr cannot possibly be an array,
// and we generate a compiler error to prevent the code from
// compiling.
//
// Since the size of bool is implementation-defined, we need to cast
// !(sizeof(a) & sizeof(*(a))) to size_t in order to ensure the final
// result has type size_t.
//
// This macro is not perfect as it wrongfully accepts certain
// pointers, namely where the pointer size is divisible by the pointee
// size.  Since all our code has to go through a 32-bit compiler,
// where a pointer is 4 bytes, this means all pointers to a type whose
// size is 3 or greater than 4 will be (righteously) rejected.
//
// Kudos to Jorg Brown for this simple and elegant implementation.

// One of the type traits, is_pod, makes it possible to query whether
// a type is a POD type. It is impossible for type_traits.h to get
// this right without compiler support, so it fails conservatively. It
// knows that fundamental types and pointers are PODs, but it can't
// tell whether user classes are PODs. The DECLARE_POD macro is used
// to inform the type traits library that a user class is a POD.
//
// Implementation note: the typedef at the end is just to make it legal
// to put a semicolon after DECLARE_POD(foo).
//
// The only reason this matters is that a few parts of the google3
// code base either require their template arguments to be PODs
// (e.g. compact_vector) or are able to use a more efficient code path
// when their template arguments are PODs (e.g. sparse_hash_map). You
// should use DECLARE_POD if you have written a class that you intend
// to use with one of those components, and if you know that your
// class satisfies all of the conditions to be a POD type.
//
// So what's a POD?  The C++ standard (clause 9 paragraph 4) gives a
// full definition, but a good rule of thumb is that a struct is a POD
// ("plain old data") if it doesn't use any of the features that make
// C++ different from C.  A POD struct can't have constructors,
// destructors, assignment operators, base classes, private or
// protected members, or virtual functions, and all of its member
// variables must themselves be PODs.
