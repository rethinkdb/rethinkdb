/* `caching_cfeed_artificial_table_backend_t` is a mixin for artificial table backends
that implements change-feeds by storing a copy of all the rows in the table. It relies on
its subclass to notify it when a row has changed; then it fetches the new value of the
row, compares it to the old value, and sends a notification if necessary. */

    `set_notifications(true)` when the first changefeed is connected, and
    `set_notifications(false)` if no changefeeds have used this artificial table for a
    while. It's OK for the subclass to call `notify_*` even if `set_notifications(false)`
    is called; this is just provided as an optimization for subclasses that would need to

    it sends an error to any changefeeds instead of sending them all the changes. It's
