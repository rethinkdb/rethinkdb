/* `cfeed_artificial_table_backend_t` is a mixin for artificial table backends that want
to support changefeeds. Because it's often expensive to generate change notifications,
backends will want to only start generating notifications when a client requests a
changefeed, and stop when no changefeeds have existed for a while. So there is some
amount of "machinery" for changefeeds that must be created when the first client connects
and then later destroyed. `cfeed_artificial_table_backend_t` contains the logic for
creating and destroying that "machinery" in a generic way. Subclasses should define their
own subclass of `cfeed_artificial_table_backend_t::machinery_t` that subscribes to
notifications and calls `send_all_change()` and `send_all_stop()` as necessary. */
