/*
 * A buf_patch_t is an in-memory representation for a patch. A patch describes
 * a specific change which can be applied to a buffer.
 * Each buffer patch has a patch counter as well as a block sequence id. The block sequence id
 * is used to determine to which version of a block the patch applies. Within
 * one version of a block, the patch counter explicitly encodes an ordering, which
 * is used to ensure that patches can be applied in the correct order
 * (even if they get serialized to disk in a different order).
 *
 * While buf_patch_t provides the general interface of a buffer patch and a few
 * universal methods, subclasses are required to implement an apply_to_buf method
 * (which executes the actual patch operation) as well as methods which handle
 * serializing and deserializing the subtype specific data.
