`btree_receive_backfill_item_update_deletion_timestamps()` (what a mouthful!) is a helper
function that the RDB protocol code calls when applying `backfill_item_t`s. When a
`backfill_item_t` only contains deletions going back to some `min_deletion_timestamp`, we
must record in the B-tree that deletions before that point have been forgotten. We do
this by erasing timestamps and deletion entries before that point in the leaf node. This
function visits every leaf node in `item.range` and erases any timestamps or deletion
entries with timestamps earlier than `item.min_deletion_timestamp`. It should be called
for every `backfill_item_t` that's applied to the B-tree, unless `item.is_single_key()`
returns `true`. */
