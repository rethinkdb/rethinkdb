 * The merger serializer is a wrapper around another serializer. It limits
 * the number of active index_writes. If more index_writes come in while
 * `max_active_writes` index_writes are already going on, the new index
 * writes are queued up.
 * The advantage of this is that multiple index writes (e.g. coming from different
 * hash shards) can be merged together, improving efficiency and significantly
 * reducing the number of disk seeks on rotational drives.
