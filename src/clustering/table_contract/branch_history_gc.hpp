/* The branch history is stored in the Raft state and again on disk on each replica. Each
replica's B-tree metainfo refers to some branches, and the `current_branches` field in
the Raft state also refers to branches. When backfilling, we use the branch history to
find the relationship between the backfiller's B-tree metainfo state and the backfillee's
B-tree metainfo state. The coordinator uses the branch history to find the relationship
between the replicas' B-tree metainfo states and the branches in the contracts in the
Raft state.

For performance reasons, we don't want the branch history to grow without bound. But we
want to make sure to preserve enough history to calculate the relationships between the
branches. So for each shard, the coordinator computes the common ancestor of the branches
in the contracts and the branches in the replicas' B-tree metainfos; it keeps only those
branches that are along the path between that common ancestor and the branches in the
contracts. The coordinator can compute that common ancestor using the replicas' contract
acks. Each individual replica also keeps those branches that are along the path from the
common ancestor to its current B-tree metainfo branches. The contract executor on each
replica determines the common ancestor by looking at the list of branches in the Raft
state. */

/* Whenever `calculate_contracts()` is going to add a new entry to `current_branches`, it
calls `copy_branch_history_for_branch()` to add the branch history for the newly-added
branch. */

/* `mark_ancestors_since_base_live()` traces the ancestry of `root` back until it finds a
branch in `base`, then keeps tracing back until it finds a branch not in `base`. All of
the branches except the last one will be removed from `remove_branches_out`.

For example, suppose that the branch history looks like this:
    zero -> A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> root
Suppose that branches `C` and `D` are in `base`. Then `root`, `C`, `D`, and `E` would be
removed from `remove_branches_out`. But if `base` were empty, then `A` and `B` would also
be removed.

This is used on the contract executor to clean up the branch history. `root` will point
to the branch that is currently in use, and `base` will point to the Raft state branch
history. */
