/* The `contract_executor_t` is responsible for executing the instructions contained in
the `contract_t`s in the `table_raft_state_t`. Each server has one `contract_executor_t`
for each table it's a replica of. The `contract_executor_t` constantly monitors the
current Raft state and compares the contracts in the Raft state against its "executions",
which represent activities it is currently performing. As contracts appear and disappear
from the Raft state, it creates, updates, and destroys executions to match. It also takes
care of forwarding the `contract_ack_t`s generated by the executions back to the
`contract_coordinator_t`. */
