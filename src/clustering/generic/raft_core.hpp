/* This file and the corresponding `raft_core.tcc` implement the Raft consensus
algorithm, as described in the paper "In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm
(Extended Version)" (2014) by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout. Because of the complexity
and subtlety of the Raft algorithm, we follow the paper closely and refer back to it
regularly. You are advised to have a copy of the paper on hand when reading or modifying
this file. The comments also occasionally refer to Diego Ongaro's dissertation,
"Consensus: Bridging Theory and Practice" (2014), as the dissertation addresses a few
subtle points that the paper does not.

These files only contains the basic Raft algorithm itself; they don't contain any
networking or storage logic. Instead, the algorithm uses abstract interfaces to send and
receive network messages and write data to persistent storage. This both keeps these
files as simple as possible and makes it easy to test the Raft algorithm using mocked-up
network and storage systems.

We support both log compaction and configuration changes. Configuration changes use the
joint-configuration mechanism described in the original paper, rather than the
one-server-at-a-time mechanism described in the dissertation.

This implementation deviates significantly from the Raft paper in that we don't actually
send a continuous stream of heartbeats from the leader to the followers. Instead, we send
a "virtual heartbeat stream"; we send a message when a server becomes leader and another
when it ceases to be leader, and we rely on the underlying networking layer to detect if
the connection has failed.

The classes in this file are templatized on a types called `state_t`, which represents
the state machine that the Raft cluster manages. Operations on the state machine are
represented by a member type `state_t::change_t`. So `state_t::change_t` is the type that
is stored in the Raft log, and `state_t` is stored when taking a snapshot.

`state_t` and `state_t::change_t` must satisfy the following requirements:
  * Both must be default-constructable, destructable, copy- and move-constructable, copy-
    and move-assignable.
  * Both must support the `==` and `!=` operators.
  * `state_t` must have a method `void apply_change(const change_t &)` which applies the
    change to the `state_t`, mutating it in place. */

`peer_id_t`. If a single server leaves a Raft cluter and then joins again, it will use a
different `raft_member_id_t` the second time. */
