    We detect whether we've heard from a leader or not by checking if
    `watchdog_leader_only` is triggered or not. This is the purpose of
    `watchdog_leader_only`. This is also the reason why `watchdog_leader_only` is set to
    wait exactly `election_timeout_min_ms` instead of a random period between
    `election_timeout_min_ms` and `election_timeout_max_ms`.

    This implementation deviates from the Raft paper in that a leader will accept a
    RequestVote RPC from the candidate as long as the candidate is in the latest config.
    Normally this should be redundant, because if the candidate is in the latest config
    then the leader should be sending it AppendEntries RPCs, and so the leader would find
    out about the newer term via the AppendEntry RPC reply from the candidate. But this
    implementation sends "virtual heartbeats" instead of real heartbeats, and it does not
    receive replies for its virtual heartbeats. So we need another mechanism for a leader
    to detect when another member has started a new term, and we're using RequestVote
