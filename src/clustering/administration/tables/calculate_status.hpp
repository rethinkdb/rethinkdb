/* There's a slight difference between `wait_for_*_readiness()` and `get_table_status()`
in how they react when the table's leader reports that all replicas are ready.
`wait_for_*_readiness()` will go ahead and run the probe read/write query even if the
leader reports everything is fine, because this will ensure that the `namespace_repo_t`
is also ready. But `get_table_status()` will go ahead and report
`table_readiness_t::finished` without running any probe queries against the
`namespace_repo_t`. This is to save work and also to make the results of
`get_table_status()` more consistent between servers. */
