/* `remote_replicator_client_t` contacts a `remote_replicator_server_t` on another server
to sign up for writes to a given shard, and then applies them to a `store_t` on the same
server. It also performs a backfill to initialize the state of the `store_t`, and handles
the transition between the backfill and the streaming writes.

There is one `remote_replicator_client_t` on each secondary replica server of each shard.
`secondary_execution_t` constructs it. */

class remote_replicator_client_t {
public:
    /* Here's how the backfill works:

    1. We sign up for a stream of writes from the `remote_replicator_server_t`. Initially
        we let the writes queue up (in the form of blocked coroutines) as they arrive.
    2. We start backfilling from the `replica_t`. We ensure that the `replica_t` is on
        the same branch as the `remote_replicator_server_t`, and that the backfill's end
        timestamp is greater than or equal to the stream's begin timestamp.
    3. Suppose that the backfill sends us the range [-inf, K) at timestamp T and the
        range [K, L) at timestamp T+1. Then we unblock the streaming write with timestamp
        T+1 but only apply it to range [-inf, K). Then when the backfill sneds us the
        range [L, M) at timestamp T+2 we unblock the streaming write with timestamp T+2
        and apply it to the range [-inf, L). This way, every change gets applied exactly
        once, either as part of a streaming write or as part of a backfill. This
        procedure relies on the fact that the backfill proceeds from left to right
        monotonically and the versions it sends increase monotonically in timestamps.
    4. Any given write only remains queued up for as long as it takes for it to be
        applied on the `replica_t` and then for another chunk with the updated timestamp
        to be sent over the network.
    5. If the `backfill_throttler_t` tells us to pause, then while the backfill is paused
        we unconditionally apply writes to the area we've already backfilled. When the
        pause ends, we resume the backfill but ensure that all future backfilled chunks
        have timestamps greater than or equal to the timestamp of the last write
        backfilled during the pause. This is because during the pause we already
        discarded the parts of the streaming writes that applied to the unbackfilled
        area, so we have to receive those changes as part of the backfill or we won't
        get them at all.

    The `remote_replicator_client_t` constructor blocks until this entire process is
    complete. The backfilled data will be safely flushed to disk by the time it returns.
