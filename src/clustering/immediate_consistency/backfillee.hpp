/* `backfillee_t` is responsible for replicating data from a `backfiller_t` on some other
server to this server. Its interface is a bit complicated because the
`remote_replicator_client_t` needs to start applying writes before the backfill is
finished, so it needs to know when the `backfillee_t` reaches a certain point and also to
change the `backfillee_t`'s minimum version during the backfill. Here are the details:

1. When `backfillee_t` is constructed, it takes ownership of the entire region covered by
`store`. Nothing else is allowed to write to this region.

2. Call `go()` to start the backfill.

3. The backfill will proceed from left to right in lexicographical key order.

4. The state that is backfilled is guaranteed to be at least as up-to-date as the state
that the other server had at the time that `go()` was called.

5. Whenever the backfill finishes processing a range of keys, it calls `on_progress()` on
the callback, with a `region_t` representing that range.

6. If `on_progress()` returns `true`, then all keys in that region are "released" by the
`backfillee_t`, meaning that it will not write to that region, and other things are now
allowed to write to that region. If `on_progress()` returns `false`, then the backfiller
retains ownership of that region of keys.

7. The backfill continues until `on_progress()` returns `false` or the backfill is
completed. If the backfill is aborted early by returning `false`, the caller can call
`go()` again to resume the backfill. The effect of this is to reset the minimum state
that the backfill is guaranteed to go to; any keys backfilled during the new call to
`go()` are guaranteed to be at least as up-to-date as the other server's state when the
new call to `go()` happens. */
