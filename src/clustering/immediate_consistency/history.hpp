/* The type `version_t` uniquely identifies the state of some region of a RethinkDB table
at some point in time. Every read operation that passes through a `broadcaster_t` will
get all its data from the version that the broadcaster is at at the time that the read
arrives. Every write operation that passes through a `broadcaster_t` will transition the
data from one `version_t` to the next.

`version_t` internally consists of two parts: a `branch_id_t` and a timestamp. For the
`version_t::zero()`, which is the version of the initial empty database, the
`branch_id_t` is nil and the timestamp is 0. Any other version than `version_t::zero()`
belongs to a `broadcaster_t`. The `branch_id_t` will be a new UUID that was generated
when the `broadcaster_t` was created, and the timestamp will be a number that the
`broadcaster_t` increments every time a write operation passes through it. (Warning: The
timestamp is usually not zero for a new `broadcaster_t`.) */

relationship between branches and `broadcaster_t`s.

Thus, the branches form a directed acyclic graph. The branch created by the first primary
"descends" from `version_t::zero()`. When a primary is created as a replacement for an
unavailable primary, its branch descends from the branch of the unavailable primary. When
shards are split or merged, the newly-created branches may descend from part of a single
existing branch or from part of several existing branches.

When a primary is created, it publishes a `branch_birth_certificate_t` that describes its
newly-created branch. */
