/* Each shard has a `broadcaster_t` on its primary machine. Each machine sends
queries via `cluster_namespace_interface_t` over the network to the `master_t`
on the primary machine, which forwards the queries to the `broadcaster_t`. From
there, the `broadcaster_t` distributes them to one or more `listener_t`s.

When the `broadcaster_t` is first created, it generates a new unique branch ID.
The `broadcaster_t` is the authority on what sequence of operations is performed
on that branch. The order in which write and read operations pass through the
`broadcaster_t` is the order in which they are performed at the B-trees
themselves. */
