/* The type `version_t` uniquely identifies the state of some region of a
RethinkDB table at some point in time. Every read operation that passes through
a `broadcaster_t` will get all its data from the version that the broadcaster is
at at the time that the read arrives. Every write operation that passes through
a `broadcaster_t` will transition the data from one `version_t` to the next.

`version_t` internally consists of two parts: a `branch_id_t` and a timestamp.
For the `version_t::zero()`, which is the version of the initial empty database,
the `branch_id_t` is nil and the timestamp is 0. Any other version than
`version_t::zero()` belongs to a `broadcaster_t`. The `branch_id_t` will be
a new UUID that the `broadcaster_t` generated when it was created, and the
timestamp will be a number that the `broadcaster_t` increments every time a
write operation passes through it. (Warning: The timestamp is usually not zero
for a new `broadcaster_t`.) */

The reason we store `version_range_t` instead of `version_t` is that if a
backfill were interrupted, we wouldn't know which keys were up-to-date and
which were not. All that we would know is that each key's state lay at some

and the sequence of writes that pass through a `broadcaster_t` are collectively
referred to as a "branch". When a new broadcaster is created, it records the
meta-info of the store.

Thus, the branches form a directed acyclic graph. The branch created by the
first primary "descends" from `version_t::zero()`. When a primary is created as
a replacement for a dead primary, its branch descends from the branch of the
dead primary. When shards are split or merged, the newly-created branches may
descend from part of a single existing branch or from part of several existing
branches.

persisting the data to disk.

The `branch_history_manager_t` does not automatically synchronize the branch
history across the network. Automatic synchronization would be susceptible to
race conditions: if a `version_t` were sent across the network before the
birth certificate for the corresponding branch were sent, then the receiving end
might try to look up the birth certificate for that branch and not find it.
Instead, it is the responsibility of the `backfiller_t`, `broadcaster_t`, and so
on to send the appropriate branch history information along with any
`branch_id_t` they send across the network. They do this by calling
`export_branch_history()`, then passing the resulting `branch_history_t` object
along with the `branch_id_t`, then calling `import_branch_history()` at the
destination before trying to use the `branch_id_t` for anything. */
