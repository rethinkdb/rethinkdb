 * @define {boolean} Use contentEditable in FF.
 * There are a number of known bugs when the only content in your field is
 * inline (e.g. just text, no block elements):
 * -indent is a noop and then DOMSubtreeModified events stop firing until
 *    the structure of the DOM is changed (e.g. make something bold).
 * -inserting lists inserts just a NBSP, no list!
 * Once those two are fixed, we should have one client guinea pig it and put
 * it through a QA run. If we can file the bugs with Mozilla, there's a chance
 * they'll fix them for a dot release of Firefox 3.
