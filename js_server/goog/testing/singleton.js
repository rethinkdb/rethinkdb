/**
 * @fileoverview This module simplifies testing code which uses stateful
 * singletons. {@code goog.testing.singleton.reset} resets all instances, so
 * next time when {@code getInstance} is called, a new instance is created.
 * It's recommended to reset the singletons in {@code tearDown} to prevent
 * interference between subsequent tests.
 *
 * The {@code goog.testing.singleton} functions expect that the goog.DEBUG flag
 * is enabled, and the tests are either uncompiled or compiled without renaming.
