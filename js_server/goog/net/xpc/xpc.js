/**
 * @fileoverview Provides the namesspace for client-side communication

 * The only publicly visible class is goog.net.xpc.CrossPageChannel.
 *
 * Note: The preferred name for the main class would have been
 * CrossDomainChannel.  But as there already is a class named like
 * that (which serves a different purpose) in the maps codebase,
 * CrossPageChannel was chosen to avoid confusion.
 *
 * CrossPageChannel abstracts the underlying transport mechanism to
 * provide a common interface in all browsers.
