### Compatibility ###

On 32-bit platforms and on Windows (64 and 32 bit), RethinkDB 2.3.6 servers should not
be mixed with servers running RethinkDB 2.3.3 or older in the same cluster. Doing so can lead to
server crashes when using the web UI or when accessing the `logs` system table.

On 64-bit platforms, RethinkDB 2.3.6 servers can be mixed with older RethinkDB 2.3.x
servers in the same cluster. We recommend that you run a mixed-version cluster only
temporarily for upgrading purposes.

No migration is required when upgrading from RethinkDB 2.3.x. Please read the
[RethinkDB 2.3.0 release notes][release-notes-2.3.0] if you're upgrading from an
older version.

# Release 2.3.3 (Fantasia)

Released on 2016-06-01

Bug fix release

### Compatibility ###

RethinkDB 2.3.3 servers can be mixed with older RethinkDB 2.3.x servers in the same
cluster. We recommend that you run a mixed-version cluster only temporarily for upgrading
purposes.

No migration is required when upgrading from RethinkDB 2.3.x. Please read the

### Windows support ###

RethinkDB 2.3.0 was the first version to include native Windows compatibility. In
RethinkDB 2.3.3, the Windows port is ready to emerge from "beta" testing. We now
officially support RethinkDB on the Windows platform alongside our existing support for
Linux and Mac OS X. We're also extending our [commercial support][comm-support] services
to include RethinkDB on Windows.

Although RethinkDB is now stable on Windows, there are still a few [remaining limitations][windows-tag]
that we are actively working to address. We also haven't yet carried out as much
performance tuning on the Windows port as we have on the Linux and OS X releases.

# Release 2.3.0 (Fantasia)

Released on 2016-04-06

RethinkDB 2.3 introduces a users and permissions system, TLS encrypted connections, a
Windows beta, and numerous improvements to the ReQL query language. ReQL improvements
include up to 10x better performance for distributed joins, and a new `fold` command that
allows you to implement efficient stateful transformations on streams.

Read the [blog post][2.3-release] for more details.

[2.3-release]: http://rethinkdb.com/blog/2.3-release/

## Compatibility ##

Data files from RethinkDB version 1.16 onward will be automatically migrated.
As with any major release, back up your data files before performing the upgrade.

If you're upgrading from RethinkDB 1.15.x or earlier, please read the
[data migration guide][data-migration-docs] to find out about the required migration steps.

RethinkDB 2.3.0 servers cannot be mixed with servers running RethinkDB 2.2.x or earlier
in the same cluster.

[data-migration-docs]: http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/migration/

### Managing password-protected clusters ###

If you migrate a cluster from a previous version of RethinkDB and have an `auth_key` set,
the `auth_key` is turned into the password for the `"admin"` user. If no `auth_key` is
set, a new `"admin"` user with an empty password is automatically created during
migration.

RethinkDB 2.3 adds a new restriction when adding a server to an existing cluster. If
the existing cluster has a non-empty password set for the `"admin"` user, a new server
is only allowed to join the cluster if it has a password set as well. This is to avoid
insecure states during the join process. You can use the new `--initial-password auto`
command line option for joining a new server or proxy to a password-protected cluster.
The `--initial-password auto` option assigns a random `"admin"` password on startup,
which gets overwritten by the previously configured password on the cluster once the join
process is complete.

### API-breaking changes ###

* The `eqJoin` command no longer returns results in the order of its first input. You can
  pass in the new `{ordered: true}` option to restore the previous behavior.
* Operations on geospatial multi-indexes now emit duplicate results if multiple index
  keys of a given document match the query. You can append the `.distinct()` command in
  order to restore the previous behavior.
* Changefeeds on queries of the form `orderBy(...).limit(...).filter(...)` are no longer
  allowed. Previous versions of RethinkDB allowed the creation of such changefeeds, but
  did not provide the correct semantics.
* The commands `r.wait`, `r.rebalance` and `r.reconfigure` can no longer be called on the
  global `r` scope. Previously, these commands defaulted to the `"test"` database
  implicitly. Now they have to be explicitly called on either a database or table object.
  For example: `r.db("test").wait()`, `r.db("test").rebalance()`, etc.
* The `{returnChanges: "always"}` option with the `insert` command will now add
  `{error: "..."}` documents to the `changes` array if the insert fails for some
  documents. Previously failed documents were simply omitted from the `changes` result.
* The special values `r.minval` and `r.maxval` are no longer permitted as return values
  of secondary index functions.

### Deprecated APIs ###

* The JavaScript `each` function is deprecated in favor of `eachAsync`. In a
  future release, `each` will be turned into an alias of `eachAsync`. We recommend
  converting existing calls of the form `.each(function(err, row) {})` into the
  `eachAsync` equivalent `.eachAsync(function(row) {}, function(err) {})`.
  You can read more about [`eachAsync` in the documentation][eachAsync-api].
* The `auth_key` option to `connect` in the official drivers is deprecated in favor of
  the new `user` and `password` options. For now, a provided `auth_key` value is mapped
  by the drivers to a password for the `"admin"` user, so existing code will keep
  working.

[eachAsync-api]: http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/each_async/

### Discontinued packages ###

We no longer provide packages for the Debian oldstable distribution 7.x (Wheezy).

When compiling from source, the minimum required GCC version is now 4.7.4.

## New features ##

* Added support for user accounts, user authentication, and access permissions. Users can
  be configured through the `"users"` system table. Permissions can be configured through
  either the new `"permissions"` system table or through the `grant` command. (#4519)
* Driver, intracluster and web UI connections can now be configured to use TLS
  encryption. For driver and intracluster connections, the server additionally supports
  certificate verification. (Linux and OS X only, #5381)
* Added beta support for running RethinkDB on Windows (64 bit only, Windows 7 and up).
  (#1100)
* Added a `fold` command to allow stateful transformations on ordered streams. (#3736)
* Added support for changefeeds on `getIntersecting` queries. (#4777)

## Improvements ##

* Server
 * The `--bind` option can now be specified separately for the web UI (`--bind-http`),
   client driver port (`--bind-driver`) and cluster port (`--bind-cluster`). (#5467)
 * RethinkDB servers now detect non-transitive connectivity in the cluster and raise a
   `"non_transitive_error"` issue in the `"current_issues"` system table when detecting
   an issue. Additionally, the `"server_status"` system table now contains information on
   each server's connectivity in the new `connected_to` field. (#4936)
 * Added a new `"memory_error"` issue type for the `"current_issues"` system table that
   is displayed when the RethinkDB process starts using swap space. (Linux only) (#1023)
 * Reduced the number of scenarios that require index migration after a RethinkDB
   upgrade. Indexes no longer need to be migrated unless they use a custom index
   function. (#5175)
 * Added support for compiling RethinkDB on Alpine Linux. (#4437)
 * Proxy servers now print their server ID on startup. (#5515)
 * Raised the maximum query size from 64 MB to 128 MB. (#4529)
 * Increased the maximum number of shards for a table from 32 to 64. (#5311)
 * Implemented a `--join-delay` option to better tolerate unstable network conditions
   (#5319)
 * Added an `--initial-password` command line option to secure the process of adding new
   servers to a password-protected cluster. (#5490)
 * Implemented a new client protocol handshake to support user authentication. (#5406)
* ReQL
 * Added an `interleave` option to the `union` command to allow merging streams in a
   particular order. (#5090)
 * Added support for custom conflict-resolution functions to the `insert` command.
   (#3753)
 * The `insert` command now returns changes in the same order in which they were passed
   in when the `returnChanges` option is used. (#5041)
 * Added an `includeOffsets` option to the `changes` command to obtain the positions
   of changed elements in an `orderBy.limit` changefeeds. (#5334)
 * Added an `includeTypes` option to the `changes` command that adds a `type` field to
   every changefeed result. (#5188)
 * Made geospatial multi-indexes behave consistently with non-geospatial multi-indexes
   if a document is indexed under multiple matching keys. `getIntersecting` and
   `getNearest` now return duplicates if multiple index keys match. (#3351)
 * The `and`, `or` and `getAll` commands can now be called with zero arguments.
   (#4696, #2588)
 * Disallowed calling `r.wait`, `r.rebalance` and `r.reconfigure` on the global scope to
   avoid confusing semantics. (#4382)
 * The `count` and `slice` commands can now be applied to strings. (#4227, #4228)
 * Improved the error message from `reconfigure` if too many servers are unreachable.
   (#5267)
 * Improved the error message for invalid timezone specifications. (#1280)
* Performance
 * Implemented efficient batching for distributed joins using the `eqJoin` command.
   (#5115)
 * Optimized `tableCreate` to complete more quickly. (#4746)
 * Reduced the CPU overhead of ReQL function calls and term evaluation. (no issue number)
* Web UI
 * The web UI now uses the `conn.server()` command for getting information about the
   connected server. (#5059)
* All drivers
 * Implemented a new protocol handshake and added `user` and `password` options to the
   `connect` method to enable user authentication. (#5458, #5459, #5460, #5461)
 * Added `clientPort` and `clientAddress` functions to the connection objects in the
   JavaScript, Python and Ruby drivers. (#4796)
* JavaScript driver
 * Added new variants of the `cursor.eachAsync` function. (#5056)
 * Added a `concurrency` option for `cursor.eachAsync`. (#5529)
 * `r.min`, `r.max`, `r.sum`, `r.avg` and `r.distinct` now accept an array argument
   (#4594)
* Python driver
 * Added a `"gevent"` loop type to the Python driver. (#4433)
 * Printing a cursor object now displays the first few results. (#5331)
 * Removed the dependency on `tar` for the `rethinkdb restore` and `rethinkdb dump`
   commands. (#5399)
 * Added a `--tls-cert` option to the `rethinkdb import`, `rethinkdb export`,
   `rethinkdb dump`, `rethinkdb restore` and `rethinkdb index-rebuild` commands to enable
   TLS connections. (#5330)
 * Added `--password` and `--password-file` options to the `rethinkdb import`,
   `rethinkdb export`, `rethinkdb dump`, `rethinkdb restore` and
   `rethinkdb index-rebuild` commands to connect to password-protected servers. (#5464)
 * Added a `--format ndjson` option to `rethinkdb export` that allows exporting tables
   in a newline-separated JSON format. (#5101)
 * Made `rethinkdb dump` `rethinkdb restore` and `rethinkdb import` able to write to
   stdout and load data from stdin respectively. (#5525, #3838)
 * `r.min`, `r.max`, `r.sum`, `r.avg` and `r.distinct` now accept an array argument
   (#5494)
* Java driver:
 * Made it easier to publish the driver on local Ivy and Maven repositories. (#5054)

# Release 2.2.4 (Modern Times)

Released on 2016-02-01

This bug fix release addresses a [critical bug][issue-5289-details] in RethinkDB's clustering system,
that can lead to data loss and invalid query results under certain rare
circumstances. The bug can appear if a table is reconfigured during a network
partition (read more in [GitHub issue #5289][issue-5289-details]).

We recommend upgrading to this release as soon as possible to avoid data loss.

If you see replicas get stuck in the `transitioning` state during a reconfiguration
after upgrading, you can run `.reconfigure({emergencyRepair: '_debug_recommit'})`
on the table to allow the reconfiguration to complete. Please make sure that the
cluster is idle when running this operation, as RethinkDB does not guarantee
consistency during the emergency repair.

[issue-5289-details]: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5289#issuecomment-175394540

### Compatibility ###

RethinkDB 2.2.4 servers cannot be mixed with servers running RethinkDB 2.2.1 or earlier
in the same cluster.

No migration is required when upgrading from RethinkDB 2.2.0 or higher. Please read the

# Release 2.2.0 (Modern Times)

Released on 2015-11-12

RethinkDB 2.2 introduces atomic changefeeds. Atomic changefeeds include existing values
from the database into the changefeed result, and then atomically transition to streaming
updates.

Atomic changefeeds make building realtime apps dramatically easier: you can use
a single code path to populate your application with initial data, and continue receiving
realtime data updates.

This release also includes numerous performance and scalability improvements designed to
help RethinkDB clusters scale to larger sizes while using fewer resources.

Read the [blog post][2.2-release] for more details.

[2.2-release]: http://rethinkdb.com/blog/2.2-release/

## Compatibility ##

Data files from RethinkDB version 1.16 onward will be automatically migrated.
As with any major release, back up your data files before performing the upgrade.

If you're upgrading from RethinkDB 1.14.x or 1.15.x, you need to migrate your secondary
indexes first. You can do this by following these steps:
* Install RethinkDB 2.0.5.
* Update the RethinkDB Python driver (`sudo pip install 'rethinkdb<2.1.0'`).
* Rebuild your indexes with `rethinkdb index-rebuild`.

Afterwards, you can install RethinkDB 2.2 and start it on the existing data files.

If you're upgrading directly from RethinkDB 1.13 or earlier, you will need to manually
upgrade using `rethinkdb dump`.

### API-breaking changes ###

* Changefeeds on `.orderBy.limit` as well as `.get` queries previously provided
  initial results by default. You now need to include the optional argument
  `includeInitial: true` to `.changes` to achieve the same behavior.
* The deprecated protocol buffer driver protocol is no longer supported. The newer JSON
  protocol is now the only supported driver protocol. Older drivers using the deprecated
  protocol no longer work with RethinkDB 2.2.0. See the [drivers][drivers] list for
  up-to-date drivers.
  * If you're using Java, please note that at the time of writing, existing community
    drivers have not been updated to use the newer JSON protocol. However, an
    [official Java driver][java-driver] is in active development and will be available
    soon.
* Certain argument errors that used to throw `ReqlDriverError` exceptions now throw
  `ReqlCompileError` exceptions. See [#4669][issue-4669] for a full list of changes.

[drivers]: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/
[java-driver]: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3930
[issue-4669]: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4669#issue-100428248

### Supported distributions ###

RethinkDB 2.2.0 now comes with official packages for Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily Werewolf) and
CentOS 7.

We no longer provide packages for Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx), which has reached end of
life.

[2.1-release]: http://rethinkdb.com/blog/2.1-release/

## Compatibility ##

Data files from RethinkDB versions 1.14.0 onward will be automatically migrated.
As with any major release, back up your data files before performing the upgrade.

If you're upgrading directly from RethinkDB 1.13 or earlier, you will need to manually
upgrade using `rethinkdb dump`.

Note that files from the RethinkDB 2.1.0 beta release are not compatible with this
version.

### Changed handling of server failures ###
This release introduces a new system for dealing with server failures and network
partitions based on the Raft consensus algorithm.

Previously, unreachable servers had to be manually removed from the cluster in order to
restore availability. RethinkDB 2.1 can resolve many cases of availability loss
automatically, and keeps the cluster in an administrable state even while servers are
missing.

There are three important scenarios in RethinkDB 2.1 when it comes to restoring the
availability of a given table after a server failure:

* The table has three or more replicas, and a majority of the servers that are hosting
  these replicas are connected. RethinkDB 2.1 automatically elects new primary replicas
  to replace unavailable servers and restore availability. No manual intervention is
  required, and data consistency is maintained.
* A majority of the servers for the table are connected, regardless of the number of
  replicas. The table can be manually reconfigured using the usual commands, and data
  consistency is always maintained.
* A majority of servers for the table are unavailable. The new `emergency_repair` option
  to `table.reconfigure` can be used to restore table availability in this case.

### System table changes ###
To reflect changes in the underlying cluster administration logic, some of the tables in
the `rethinkdb` database changed.

**Changes to `table_config`:**

* Each shard subdocument now has a new field `nonvoting_replicas`, that can be set to a
  subset of the servers in the `replicas` field.
* `write_acks` must now be either `"single"` or `"majority"`. Custom write ack
  specifications are no longer supported. Instead, non-voting replicas can be used to set
  up replicas that do not count towards the write ack requirements.
* Tables that have all of their replicas disconnected are now listed as special documents
  with an `"error"` field.
* Servers that are disconnected from the cluster are no longer included in the table.
* The new `indexes` field lists the secondary indexes on the given table.

**Changes to `table_status`:**

* The `primary_replica` field is now called `primary_replicas` and has an array of
  current primary replicas as its value. While under normal circumstances only a single
  server will be serving as the primary replica for a given shard, there can temporarily
  be multiple primary replicas during handover or while data is being transferred between
  servers.
* The possible values of the `state` field now are `"ready"`, `"transitioning"`,
  `"backfilling"`, `"disconnected"`, `"waiting_for_primary"` and `"waiting_for_quorum"`.
* Servers that are disconnected from the cluster are no longer included in the table.

**Changes to `current_issues`:**

* The issue types `"table_needs_primary"`, `"data_lost"`, `"write_acks"`,
  `"server_ghost"` and `"server_disconnected"` can no longer occur.
* A new issue type `"table_availability"` was added and appears whenever a table is
  missing at least one server. Note that no issue is generated if a server which is not
  hosting any replicas disconnects.

**Changes to `cluster_config`:**

* A new document with the `id` `"heartbeat"` allows configuring the heartbeat timeout for
  intracluster connections.

### New ReQL error types ###
RethinkDB 2.1 introduces new error types that allow you to handle different error classes
separately in your application if you need to. You can find the
[complete list][error-types] of new error types in the documentation.

As part of this change, ReQL error types now use the `Reql` name prefix instead of `Rql`
(for example `ReqlRuntimeError` instead of `RqlRuntimeError`).
The old type names are still supported in our drivers for backwards compatibility.

[error-types]: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/error-types/

### Other API-breaking changes ###

* `.split('')` now treats the input as UTF-8 instead of an array of bytes
* `null` values in compound index are no longer discarded
* The new `read_mode="outdated"` optional argument replaces `use_outdated=True`

### Deprecated functionality ###
The older protocol-buffer-based client protocol is deprecated in this release. RethinkDB
2.2 will no longer support clients that still use it. All "current" drivers listed on
the [drivers page][drivers] use the new JSON-based protocol and will continue to work
with RethinkDB 2.2.

## Compatibility ##

Data files from RethinkDB versions 1.13.0 onward will be automatically
migrated to version 2.0. As with any major release, back up your data files
before performing the upgrade.

### Handling of negative zero in indexes ###

IEEE 754 floating point numbers distinguish between negative (-0) and
positive (+0) zero.  The following information is only relevant if you
are storing negative zero values in your documents.  We expect very
few users to be affected by this change.

ReQL compares -0 and +0 as equal in accordance with IEEE 754.  In
previous versions of RethinkDB, -0 and +0 were however treated as
distinct values in primary and secondary indexes.  This could lead to
inconsistent behavior and wrong query results in some rare cases.

Starting with RethinkDB 2.0, -0 and +0 are indexed as equal values.
Secondary indexes can be [migrated online][1.14-outdated-index] using
the `rethinkdb index-rebuild` utility.  If any of your documents have
negative zero values in their primary keys, those documents will
become partially inaccessible in RethinkDB 2.0. You will need to
re-import the affected tables using the `rethinkdb dump` and
`rethinkdb restore` commands. See the article "[Back up your
data][backup-docs]" for more information.

If you are unsure if any of your documents are affected, you can run
`python -m rethinkdb._negative_zero_check` after upgrading both the
server and Python driver.  See the output of `python -m
rethinkdb._negative_zero_check --help` for additional options.

[1.14-outdated-index]: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#my-secondary-index-is-outdated
[backup-docs]: http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/backup/

### API-breaking changes ###

* `between` no longer accepts `null` bounds. The new `r.minval` and
  `r.maxval` can be used instead

* The `any` and `all` commands have been removed. The `or` and `and`
  commands can be used instead

* `indexes_of` has been renamed to `offsets_of`

* The `squash` argument to `changes` now defaults to `false`

* The type hierarchy for exception types in the Python driver changed.
  All exceptions including `RqlDriverError` now inherit from the
  `RqlError` type.  `RqlRuntimeError`, `RqlCompileError` and
  `RqlClientError` additionally inherit from the new `RqlQueryError`
  type

Released on 2015-01-29

The highlights of this release are:
* A new administration API
* Changefeeds on complex queries
* Numerous improvements and enhancements throughout RethinkDB

Read the [release blog post][1.16-blog] for more details.

[1.16-blog]: http://rethinkdb.com/blog/1.16-release/

## Compatibility ##

### Backwards-compatible changes ###

Data files from RethinkDB versions 1.13.0 onward will be automatically
migrated to version 1.16.x. As with any major release, back up your data files
before performing the upgrade. If you are upgrading from a release earlier
than 1.13.0, follow the [migration instructions][migration-documentation] before upgrading.

[migration-documentation]: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/migration/

Secondary indexes now use a new format; old indexes will continue to work, but
you should rebuild indexes after upgrading to 1.16.x. A warning about outdated
indexes will be issued on startup.

Indexes can be migrated to the new format with the `rethinkdb index-rebuild`
utility. Consult the [troubleshooting document][outdated-indexes-documentation] for more information.

[outdated-indexes-documentation]: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/troubleshooting#my-secondary-index-is-outdated

The abstraction of datacenters has been replaced by [server tags][server-tags-documentation].
Existing datacenter assignments will be converted to server tags automatically.

[server-tags-documentation]: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/sharding-and-replication/

### API-breaking changes ###

The `tableCreate`, `tableDrop`, `dbCreate` and `dbDrop` terms have a new set of return values.
The previous return values `created` and `dropped` have been renamed to `tables_creates` / `dbs_created` and
`tables_dropped` / `dbs_dropped` respectively. The terms now additionally return a `config_changes` field.

Consult the API documentation for these commands for details:

Changefeeds on a table now combine multiple changes to the same document into a single notification if they happen rapidly.
You can turn this behavior off by passing the `squash: false` optional argument (see the
[API documentation][changes-api-docs] for details).

Strings passed to ReQL are now rejected if they are not valid UTF-8.
Non UTF-8 conformant data can be stored as [binary][binary-api-docs] data instead.

# Release 1.15.0 (Lawrence of Arabia)

Released on 2014-09-23

The highlights of this release are support for geospatial objects and queries,
and significant performance upgrades relating to datum serialization (twice as
fast for many analytical workloads). Read the [release blog post][1.15-blog]
for more details.

[1.15-blog]: http://rethinkdb.com/blog/1.15-release/

Only documents modified after upgrading to 1.15 will receive these performance
gains. You may "upgrade" older documents by performing any write that modifies
their contents. For example, you could add a dummy field to all the documents in
a table and then remove it:

    r.table('tablename').update({dummy_field: true})
    r.table('tablename').replace(r.row.without('dummy_field'))

There are no API-breaking changes in this release.

## New features ##

  * Improved the performance of `zip` by replacing the `zip_datum_stream_t` type
    with a transformer function (#2654)
  * Clarified error messages when the data in the selection could not be printed
    (#972)

# Release 1.14.0 (Brazil)

Released on 2014-08-20

The highlights of this release are:

* Support for storing binary data
* Seamless database migration
* Support for Python 3

Read the [release blog post][1.14-blog] for more details.

[1.14-blog]: http://rethinkdb.com/blog/1.14-release/

## Compatibility ##

### Backwards-compatible changes ###

Data files from RethinkDB versions 1.13.0 onward will be automatically
migrated to version 1.14.x. As with any major release, back up your data files
before performing the upgrade. If you are upgrading from a release earlier
than 1.13.0, follow the [migration instructions][1.14-migration] before upgrading:

[1.14-migration]: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/migration/

Secondary indexes now use a new format; old indexes will continue to work, but
you should rebuild indexes after upgrading to 1.14.x. A warning about outdated
indexes will be issued on startup.

Indexes can be migrated to the new format with the `rethinkdb index-rebuild`
utility. Consult the [troubleshooting document][1.14-outdated-index] for more
information:

[1.14-outdated-index]: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#my-secondary-index-is-outdated

### API-breaking changes ###

The `return_vals` optional argument for `insert`, `delete` and `update` has
been changed to `return_changes`, and works with all write operations
(previously, this only worked with single-document writes). The returned
object is in a new format that is backwards-incompatible with previous
versions. Consult the API documentation for [insert][1.14-insert], [delete][1.14-delete],
and [update][1.14-update] for details:

[1.14-insert]: http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/insert
[1.14-delete]: http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/delete
[1.14-update]: http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/update

The `upsert` optional argument to `insert` has been replaced with `conflict`
and new allowed values of `error`, `replace` or `update`. This is a
backwards-incompatible change. Consult the API documentation for more
information.

## New features ##

* Server

# Release 1.2.0 (Rashomon)

Released on 2012-11-09.

## Changes ##

This is the first release of the product. It includes:

* JSON data model and immediate consistency support
* Distributed joins, subqueries, aggregation, atomic updates
* Hadoop-style map/reduce
* Friendly web and command-line administration tools
* Takes care of machine failures and network interrupts
* Multi-datacenter replication and failover
* Sharding and replication to multiple nodes
* Queries are automatically parallelized and distributed
* Lock-free operation via MVCC concurrency

## Limitations ##

There are a number of technical limitations that aren't baked into the
architecture, but were not resolved in this release due to time
pressure. They will be resolved in subsequent releases.

* Write requests have minimal batching in memory and are flushed to
  disk on every write. This significantly limits write performance,
  expecially on rotational disks.
* Range commands currently don't use an index.
* The clustering system has a bottleneck in cluster metadata
  propagation. Cluster management slows down significantly when more
  than sixteen shards are used.
