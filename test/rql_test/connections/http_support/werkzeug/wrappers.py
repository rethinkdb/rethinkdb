    werkzeug.wrappers
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The wrappers are simple request and response objects which you can
    subclass to do whatever you want them to do.  The request object contains
    the information transmitted by the client (webbrowser) and the response
    object contains all the information sent back to the browser.

    An important detail is that the request object is created with the WSGI
    environ and will act as high-level proxy whereas the response object is an
    actual WSGI application.

    Like everything else in Werkzeug these objects will work correctly with
    unicode data.  Incoming form data parsed by the response object will be
    decoded into an unicode object if possible and if it makes sense.

    """Very basic request object.  This does not implement advanced stuff like
    entity tag parsing or cache controls.  The request object is created with
    the WSGI environment as first argument and will add itself to the WSGI
    environment as ``'werkzeug.request'`` unless it's created with
    `populate_request` set to False.

    There are a couple of mixins available that add additional functionality
    to the request object, there is also a class called `Request` which
    subclasses `BaseRequest` and all the important mixins.

    It's a good idea to create a custom subclass of the :class:`BaseRequest`
    and add missing functionality either via mixins or direct implementation.
    Here an example for such subclasses::

        from werkzeug.wrappers import BaseRequest, ETagRequestMixin

        class Request(BaseRequest, ETagRequestMixin):
            pass

    Request objects are **read only**.  As of 0.5 modifications are not
    allowed in any place.  Unlike the lower level parsing functions the
    request object will use immutable objects everywhere possible.

    Per default the request object will assume all the text data is `utf-8`
    encoded.  Please refer to `the unicode chapter <unicode.txt>`_ for more
    details about customizing the behavior.

    Per default the request object will be added to the WSGI
    environment as `werkzeug.request` to support the debugging system.
    If you don't want that, set `populate_request` to `False`.

    If `shallow` is `True` the environment is initialized as shallow
    object around the environ.  Every operation that would modify the
    environ in any way (such as consuming form data) raises an exception
    unless the `shallow` attribute is explicitly set to `False`.  This
    is useful for middlewares where you don't want to consume the form
    data by accident.  A shallow request is not populated to the WSGI
    environment.

class BaseResponse(object):
    """Base response class.  The most important fact about a response object
    is that it's a regular WSGI application.  It's initialized with a couple
    of response parameters (headers, body, status code etc.) and will start a
    valid WSGI response when called with the environ and start response
    callable.

    Because it's a WSGI application itself processing usually ends before the
    actual response is sent to the server.  This helps debugging systems
    because they can catch all the exceptions before responses are started.

    Here a small example WSGI application that takes advantage of the
    response objects::

        from werkzeug.wrappers import BaseResponse as Response

        def index():
            return Response('Index page')

        def application(environ, start_response):
            path = environ.get('PATH_INFO') or '/'
            if path == '/':
                response = index()
            else:
                response = Response('Not Found', status=404)
            return response(environ, start_response)

    Like :class:`BaseRequest` which object is lacking a lot of functionality
    implemented in mixins.  This gives you a better control about the actual
    API of your response objects, so you can create subclasses and add custom
    functionality.  A full featured response object is available as
    :class:`Response` which implements a couple of useful mixins.

    To enforce a new type of already existing responses you can use the
    :meth:`force_type` method.  This is useful if you're working with different
    subclasses of response objects and you want to post process them with a
    know interface.

    Per default the request object will assume all the text data is `utf-8`
    encoded.  Please refer to `the unicode chapter <unicode.txt>`_ for more
    details about customizing the behavior.

    Response can be any kind of iterable or string.  If it's a string it's
    considered being an iterable with one item which is the string passed.
    Headers can be a list of tuples or a
    :class:`~werkzeug.datastructures.Headers` object.

    Special note for `mimetype` and `content_type`:  For most mime types
    `mimetype` and `content_type` work the same, the difference affects
    only 'text' mimetypes.  If the mimetype passed with `mimetype` is a
    mimetype starting with `text/`, the charset parameter of the response
    object is appended to it.  In contrast the `content_type` parameter is
    always added as header unmodified.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.5
