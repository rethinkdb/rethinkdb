    :meth:`~flask.Flask.request_context` to create this object.

    When the request context is popped, it will evaluate all the
    functions registered on the application for teardown execution
    (:meth:`~flask.Flask.teardown_request`).

    The request context is automatically popped at the end of the request
    for you.  In debug mode the request context is kept around if
    exceptions happen so that interactive debuggers have a chance to
    introspect the data.  With 0.4 this can also be forced for requests
    that did not fail and outside of `DEBUG` mode.  By setting
    ``'flask._preserve_context'`` to `True` on the WSGI environment the
    context will not pop itself at the end of the request.  This is used by
    the :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_client` for example to implement the
    deferred cleanup functionality.

    You might find this helpful for unittests where you need the
    information from the context local around for a little longer.  Make
    sure to properly :meth:`~werkzeug.LocalStack.pop` the stack yourself in
    that situation, otherwise your unittests will leak memory.
