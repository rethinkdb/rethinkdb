    # <b>NOTE:</b> unlike Ruby's reduce, this reduce only works on
    # sequences with elements of the same type as the base case.  For
    # example, the following is incorrect:
    #   table.reduce(0){|a,b| a + b[:count]}

    # This one is a little complicated.  The logic is as follows:
    # 1. Use <b>+grouping+</b> sort the elements into groups.  <b>+grouping+</b> should be a callable that takes one argument, the current element of the sequence, and returns a JSON expression representing its group.
    # 2. Map <b>+mapping+</b> over each of the groups.  Mapping should be a callable that behaves the same as the block passed to Sequence#map.
    # 3. Reduce the groups with <b>+base+</b> and <b>+reduction+</b>.  Base should be the base term of the reduction, and <b>+reduction+</b> should be a callable that behaves the same as the block passed to Sequence#reduce.
    #
    # For example, the following are equivalent:
    #   table.groupedmapreduce(lambda {|row| row[:id] % 4},
    #                          lambda {|row| row[:id]},

    #     table.filter{|row| row[:id].eq(n)}.map{|row| row[:id]}.reduce(0){|a,b| a+b}

    # it only has to traverse <b>+table+</b> once.
