module RethinkDB
  # A query returning a JSON expression.  Most of the functions that you
  # can run on a JSON object are found in RethinkDB::RQL and accessed
  # with the <b>+r+</b> shortcut.  For convenience, may of the
  # functions in Rethinkdb::RQL can be run as if they were instance
  # methods of JSON_Expression.  For example, the following are
  # equivalent:
  #   r.add(1, 2)
  #   r(1).add(2)
  #   r(3)
  #
  # Running a JSON_Expression query will return a literal Ruby
  # representation of the resulting JSON, rather than a stream or a
  # string.  For example, the following are equivalent:
  #   r.add(1,2).run
  #   3
  # As are:
  #   r({:a => 1, :b => 2}).pick(:a).run
  #   {'a' => 1}
  # (Note that the symbol keys were coerced into string keys in the
  # object.  JSON doesn't distinguish between symbols and strings.)
  class JSON_Expression
    # If <b>+ind+</b> is a symbol or a string, gets the corresponding
    # attribute of an object.  For example, the following are equivalent:
    #   r({:id => 1})[:id]
    #   r({:id => 1})['id']
    #   r(1)
    # Otherwise, if <b>+ind+</b> is a number or a range, invokes RethinkDB::Sequence#[]

    # and handle both arrays and streams, when arrays or streams need to be
    # combined (e.g. via <b>+union+</b>) you need to explicitly convert between
    # the types.  This is mostly for safety, but also because which type you're
    # working with affects error handling.  The following are equivalent:
