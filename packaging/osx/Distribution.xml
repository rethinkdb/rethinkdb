The software is released under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public\
License, version 3\
\
                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007\
\
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/\
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copie\
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed\
\
                            Preamble\
\
  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license fo\
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensur\
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software\
\
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designe\
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast\
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom t\
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains fre\
software for all its users\
\
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, no\
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that yo\
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge fo\
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if yo\
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in ne\
free programs, and that you know you can do these things\
\
  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your right\
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offe\
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribut\
and/or modify the software\
\
  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is tha\
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if the\
receive widespread use, become available for other developers t\
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened an\
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case o\
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about\
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version an\
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing it\
source code to the public\
\
  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically t\
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes availabl\
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server t\
provide the source code of the modified version running there to th\
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, o\
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the sourc\
code of the modified version\
\
  An older license, called the Affero General Public License an\
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This i\
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero ha\
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing unde\
this license\
\
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution an\
modification follow\
\
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\
\
  0. Definitions.\
\
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License\
\
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds o\
works, such as semiconductor masks\
\
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under thi\
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" an\
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations\
\
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the wor\
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of a\
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of th\
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work\
\
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work base\
on the Program\
\
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, withou\
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable fo\
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on \
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying\
distribution (with or without modification), making available to th\
public, and in some countries other activities as well\
\
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables othe\
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user throug\
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying\
\
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices\
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visibl\
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2\
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to th\
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey th\
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  I\
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as \
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion\
\
  1. Source Code.\
\
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the wor\
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-sourc\
form of a work\
\
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an officia\
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case o\
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one tha\
is widely used among developers working in that language\
\
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, othe\
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form o\
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Majo\
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with tha\
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which a\
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  \
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential componen\
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating syste\
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used t\
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it\
\
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means al\
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executabl\
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts t\
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work'\
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available fre\
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities bu\
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Sourc\
includes interface definition files associated with source files fo\
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamicall\
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require\
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between thos\
subprograms and other parts of the work\
\
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that user\
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Correspondin\
Source\
\
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is tha\
same work\
\
  2. Basic Permissions.\
\
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term o\
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the state\
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimite\
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running \
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given it\
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges you\
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law\
\
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do no\
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remain\
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpos\
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide yo\
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply wit\
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you d\
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered work\
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your directio\
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies o\
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you\
\
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely unde\
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 1\
makes it unnecessary\
\
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law\
\
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technologica\
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under articl\
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, o\
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of suc\
measures\
\
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbi\
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumventio\
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect t\
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation o\
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work'\
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention o\
technological measures\
\
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies\
\
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as yo\
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously an\
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\
keep intact all notices stating that this License and an\
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code\
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give al\
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program\
\
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey\
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee\
\
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions\
\
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications t\
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under th\
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions\
\
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modifie\
    it, and giving a relevant date\
\
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it i\
    released under this License and any conditions added under sectio\
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 t\
    "keep intact all notices"\
\
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under thi\
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  Thi\
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section \
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts\
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives n\
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does no\
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it\
\
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must displa\
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactiv\
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, you\
    work need not make them do so\
\
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independen\
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work\
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program\
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called a\
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are no\
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's user\
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered wor\
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the othe\
parts of the aggregate\
\
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms\
\
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the term\
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey th\
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License\
in one of these ways\
\
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical produc\
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by th\
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical mediu\
    customarily used for software interchange\
\
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical produc\
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by \
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for a\
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that produc\
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) \
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in th\
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physica\
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price n\
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing thi\
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy th\
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge\
\
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of th\
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  Thi\
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, an\
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accor\
    with subsection 6b\
\
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designate\
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to th\
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at n\
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy th\
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place t\
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Sourc\
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party\
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintai\
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find th\
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts th\
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it i\
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements\
\
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provide\
    you inform other peers where the object code and Correspondin\
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at n\
    charge under subsection 6d\
\
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is exclude\
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not b\
included in conveying the object code work\
\
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means an\
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family\
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporatio\
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product\
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particula\
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to \
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the statu\
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular use\
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A produc\
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantia\
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represen\
the only significant mode of use of the product\
\
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods\
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to instal\
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product fro\
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information mus\
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified objec\
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely becaus\
modification has been made\
\
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, o\
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs a\
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of th\
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for \
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), th\
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanie\
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not appl\
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to instal\
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work ha\
been installed in ROM)\
\
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include \
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or update\
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or fo\
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to \
network may be denied when the modification itself materially an\
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules an\
protocols for communication across the network\
\
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided\
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicl\
documented (and with an implementation available to the public i\
source code form), and must require no special password or key fo\
unpacking, reading or copying\
\
  7. Additional Terms\
\
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of thi\
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions\
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shal\
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the exten\
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permission\
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separatel\
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed b\
this License without regard to the additional permissions\
\
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your optio\
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part o\
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their ow\
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may plac\
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work\
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission\
\
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material yo\
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders o\
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms\
\
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from th\
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; o\
\
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices o\
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Lega\
    Notices displayed by works containing it; o\
\
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, o\
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked i\
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; o\
\
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors o\
    authors of the material; o\
\
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of som\
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; o\
\
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of tha\
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions o\
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, fo\
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose o\
    those licensors and authors\
\
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "furthe\
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as yo\
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it i\
governed by this License along with a term that is a furthe\
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contain\
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under thi\
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the term\
of that license document, provided that the further restriction doe\
not survive such relicensing or conveying\
\
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, yo\
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of th\
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicatin\
where to find the applicable terms\
\
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in th\
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions\
the above requirements apply either way\
\
  8. Termination\
\
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressl\
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate o\
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights unde\
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the thir\
paragraph of section 11)\
\
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then you\
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a\
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly an\
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyrigh\
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable mean\
prior to 60 days after the cessation\
\
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder i\
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of th\
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you hav\
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from tha\
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days afte\
your receipt of the notice\
\
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate th\
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you unde\
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanentl\
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the sam\
material under section 10\
\
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies\
\
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive o\
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered wor\
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmissio\
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However\
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate o\
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you d\
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating \
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so\
\
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients\
\
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automaticall\
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify an\
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsibl\
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License\
\
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of a\
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing a\
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covere\
work results from an entity transaction, each party to tha\
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whateve\
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or coul\
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of th\
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, i\
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts\
\
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of th\
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you ma\
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise o\
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigatio\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging tha\
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering fo\
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it\
\
  11. Patents\
\
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under thi\
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  Th\
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version"\
\
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claim\
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired o\
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitte\
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version\
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as \
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  Fo\
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to gran\
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements o\
this License\
\
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-fre\
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, t\
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify an\
propagate the contents of its contributor version\
\
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any expres\
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a paten\
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not t\
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to \
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce \
patent against the party\
\
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license\
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyon\
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through \
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means\
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be s\
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of th\
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manne\
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the paten\
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you hav\
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying th\
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered wor\
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in tha\
country that you have reason to believe are valid\
\
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction o\
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, \
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the partie\
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modif\
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent licens\
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covere\
work and works based on it\
\
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include withi\
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or i\
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that ar\
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covere\
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that i\
in the business of distributing software, under which you make paymen\
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveyin\
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of th\
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminator\
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered wor\
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primaril\
for and in connection with specific products or compilations tha\
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement\
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007\
\
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limitin\
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that ma\
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law\
\
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom\
\
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement o\
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do no\
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey \
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thi\
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you ma\
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate yo\
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you conve\
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and thi\
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program\
\
  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License\
\
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify th\
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all user\
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your versio\
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Correspondin\
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Sourc\
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customar\
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Sourc\
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version \
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to th\
following paragraph\
\
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you hav\
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work license\
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a singl\
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of thi\
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work\
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by versio\
3 of the GNU General Public License\
\
  14. Revised Versions of this License\
\
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions o\
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new version\
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail t\
address new problems or concerns\
\
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If th\
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero Genera\
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have th\
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbere\
version or of any later version published by the Free Softwar\
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of th\
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever publishe\
by the Free Software Foundation\
\
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which futur\
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy'\
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes yo\
to choose that version for the Program\
\
  Later license versions may give you additional or differen\
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on an\
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow \
later version\
\
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty\
\
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED B\
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGH\
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANT\
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO\
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULA\
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRA\
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST O\
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION\
\
  16. Limitation of Liability\
\
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITIN\
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEY\
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING AN\
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF TH\
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS O\
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIR\
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS)\
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY O\
SUCH DAMAGES\
\
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16\
\
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provide\
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms\
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximate\
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with th\
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies \
copy of the Program in return for a fee\
\
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITION\
\
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Program\
\
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greates\
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make i\
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms\
\
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safes\
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivel\
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at leas\
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found\
\
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author\
\
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modif\
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published b\
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, o\
    (at your option) any later version\
\
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful\
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty o\
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See th\
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details\
\
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public Licens\
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>\
\
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail\
\
  If your software can interact with users remotely through a compute\
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users t\
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, it\
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archiv\
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and differen\
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for th\
specific requirements\
\
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school\
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary\
