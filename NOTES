# Release 1.2.0 (Rashomon) #

## Changes ##

This is the first release of the product. It includes:

* JSON data model and immediate consistency support
* Distributed joins, subqueries, aggregation, atomic updates
* Hadoop-style map/reduce
* Friendly web and command-line administration tools
* Takes care of machine failures and network interrupts
* Multi-datacenter replication and failover
* Sharding and replication to multiple nodes
* Queries are automatically parallelized and distributed
* Lock-free operation via MVCC concurrency

## Limitations ##

There are a number of technical limitations that aren't baked into the
architecture, but were not resolved in this release due to time
pressure. They will be resolved in subsequent releases.

* Write requests have minimal batching in memory and are flushed to
  disk on every write. This significantly limits write performance,
  expecially on rotational disks.
* Range commands currently don't use an index.
* The clustering system has a bottleneck in cluster metadata
  propagation. Cluster management slows down significantly when more
  than sixteen shards are used.
