## Limitations ##

There are a number of technical limitations that aren't baked into the
architecture, but were not resolved in this release due to time
pressure. They will be resolved in subsequent releases.

* Write requests have minimal batching in memory and are flushed to
  disk on every write. This significantly limits write performance,
  expecially on rotational disks.
* Range commands currently don't use an index.
* The clustering system has a bottleneck in cluster metadata
  propagation. Cluster management slows down significantly when more
  than sixteen shards are used.
