    <p class="first_question"><strong>How can service availability be restored?</strong></p>

    <p>
        To restore service availability, this server either needs to rejoin
        the cluster or be permanently removed.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What does removing a server do?</strong></p>

    <p>The server will be dropped from the cluster, service availability
        will resume, and its data will be destroyed to maintain cluster
        integrity.
