  ##################### DELIBERATE INCOMPATIBILITIES #####################

  'S15.8.2.8_A6': [PASS, FAIL_OK],  # Math.exp (less precise with --fast-math)

  # Linux for ia32 (and therefore simulators) default to extended 80 bit
  # floating point formats, so these tests checking 64-bit FP precision fail.
  # The other platforms/arch's pass these tests.
  # We follow the other major JS engines by keeping this default.
