This directory contains code for running Promise/A+ Compliance Test Suite[1].
You can download the it from [1], or by specifying --download to
tools/run-tests.py.
Promise/A+ Compliance Test Suite requires Node environment and needs some
libraries. To run it in d8 shell, we provides some emulation functions in the
lib/ directory.

 - lib/adapter.js
  - An adapter for harmony Promise used in Promise/A+ tests.
 - lib/assert.js
  - Emulates assert modules in Node.
 - lib/global.js
  - Provides global functions and variables.
 - lib/mocha.js
  - Emulates Mocha[2] test framework.
 - lib/require.j
  - Emulate require function in Node.
 - lib/run-tests.js
  - Run all describe tests.

The emulation is not complete. Upgrading Promise/A+ tests will require
changing lib/ scripts.

Sinon.JS[3], required by Promise/A+ tests, is also downloaded by run-tests.py.
