- baseUrl and name optional in optimizer? r.js -o include=a,b out=foo.js
- globals: config to help underscore case?
- remove packagePaths config.
- Just remove packages config altogether, suggest volojs for making adapter modules.
- requirejs.undef
    - example of requirejs.onError for fallback.
    - what about onError cleanup: https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/issues/156?
- allow error handler either per context, or per top-level require call.
- Config options: "main" and rename "deps" to "include" to match how build can read config now.

Next release
--------------

- ie 10, order plugin not working?

https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/issues/185

- add pluginBuilder to the load api

- problem with just require(['./relative/id']) inside a define call, the relative
  parentMap is not used because missing a function callback?

- make a note: order plugin is only useful for some top level dependencies that
do not use define/require api. otherwise mixing is bad.

- require-cs circular ref: https://github.com/jrburke/require-cs/issues/13

- Split plugins and their docs into separate repos with READMEs, keep the
  tests in requirejs repo for now.

- coffeescript 1.2 released, switch over the cs plugin.

- make a decision matrix of when to use what. Mention lowercase names for file name convention.

- order plugin not work with phantomjs build?
  CentOS 5.6 (Final), PhantomJS 1.4.1, Qt 4.7

- paths entry for socket.io to remote domain/port, but then do a require.toUrl('socket.io') and it returns
  a local path instead of the remote path?
- Should mention 'empty:' on the optimization page, particularly for excluding content.

- Try dojo with requirejs
  - http://sfoster.dojotoolkit.org/dojobox/1.7-branch/util/debug.profile.js
  - http://jsfiddle.net/sfoster/ztfdZ/

- upload plugins to cdnjs

- Spine
- handlebars
- raphael
- less
- jquery plugins


- Work on module adapter format: make sure global for jquery uses jQuery.
    - If OK, then do pull request for backbone branch.
- clarify commonjs wrapping in amd api page.

- Doc: add info about overriding requirejs.onError.
  - consider opt in fallback for define calls, detect require, doc.write it...

- Need to document define.amd.jQuery flag.
