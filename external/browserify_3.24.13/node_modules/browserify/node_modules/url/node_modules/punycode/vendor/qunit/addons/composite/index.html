		<h1>Composite</h1>
		<h3>A QUnit Addon For Running Multiple Test Files</h3>
		<p>Composite is a QUnit addon that, when handed an array of
		files, will open each of those files inside of an iframe, run
		the tests and display the results as a single suite of QUnit
		tests.</p>
		<h4>Using Composite</h4>
		<p>To use Composite, setup a standard QUnit html page as you
		would with other QUnit tests. Remember to include composite.js
		and composite.css. Then, inside of either an external js file,
		or a script block call the only new method that Composite
		exposes, QUnit.testSuites().</p><p>QUnit.testSuites() is
		passed an array of test files to run as follows:</p>
		<pre>
QUnit.testSuites([
    "test-file-1.html",
    "test-file-2.html",
    "test-file-3.html"
]);
		</pre>
		<h4>Tests</h4>
		<p>Composite has tests of it's own.</p>
		<p>
			<a href="composite-test.html">Composite Test</a>: A suite which tests the implementation of composite.<br>
			<a href="composite-demo-test.html">Composite Demo</a>: A suite which demoes how Compisite is bootstrapped and run.
