    <h1>Script Blocking Before Page Load Test</h1>
    <p><b>This test requires PHP. Rename one.dphpd in this directory to
    one.php before trying this test.</b></p>

    <p>This test looks at scripts added via appendChild before the page loads.
    Do the scripts execute in the order added to the DOM or the order in which
    they are received from the network?</p>
    
    <p>Normally after page load, IE and WebKit
    will evaluate scripts in network receive order, not in DOM order. This test
    is checking the behavior before page load.</p>
    
    <p>Expected results:<br>
    <b>ONE</b><br>
    <b>TWO</b><br>
    </p>

    <p>>Actual results: see browser console. IE and WebKit will execute scripts
    in network receive order, not in DOM order.</p>
