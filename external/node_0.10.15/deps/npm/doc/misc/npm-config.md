npm-config(7) -- More than you probably want to know about npm configuration
============================================================================

## DESCRIPTION

npm gets its configuration values from 6 sources, in this priority:

### Command Line Flags

Putting `--foo bar` on the command line sets the `foo` configuration
parameter to `"bar"`.  A `--` argument tells the cli parser to stop
reading flags.  A `--flag` parameter that is at the *end* of the
command will be given the value of `true`.

### Environment Variables

Any environment variables that start with `npm_config_` will be
interpreted as a configuration parameter.  For example, putting
`npm_config_foo=bar` in your environment will set the `foo`
configuration parameter to `bar`.  Any environment configurations that
are not given a value will be given the value of `true`.  Config
values are case-insensitive, so `NPM_CONFIG_FOO=bar` will work the
same.

### npmrc Files

The three relevant files are:

* per-user config file (~/.npmrc)
* global config file ($PREFIX/npmrc)
* npm builtin config file (/path/to/npm/npmrc)

See npmrc(5) for more details.

### Default Configs

A set of configuration parameters that are internal to npm, and are
defaults if nothing else is specified.

## Shorthands and Other CLI Niceties

The following shorthands are parsed on the command-line:

* `-v`: `--version`
* `-h`, `-?`, `--help`, `-H`: `--usage`
* `-s`, `--silent`: `--loglevel silent`
* `-q`, `--quiet`: `--loglevel warn`
* `-d`: `--loglevel info`
* `-dd`, `--verbose`: `--loglevel verbose`
* `-ddd`: `--loglevel silly`
* `-g`: `--global`
* `-l`: `--long`
* `-m`: `--message`
* `-p`, `--porcelain`: `--parseable`
* `-reg`: `--registry`
* `-v`: `--version`
* `-f`: `--force`
* `-desc`: `--description`
* `-S`: `--save`
* `-D`: `--save-dev`
* `-O`: `--save-optional`
* `-B`: `--save-bundle`
* `-y`: `--yes`
* `-n`: `--yes false`
* `ll` and `la` commands: `ls --long`

If the specified configuration param resolves unambiguously to a known
configuration parameter, then it is expanded to that configuration
parameter.  For example:

    npm ls --par
    # same as:
    npm ls --parseable

If multiple single-character shorthands are strung together, and the
resulting combination is unambiguously not some other configuration
param, then it is expanded to its various component pieces.  For
example:

    npm ls -gpld
    # same as:
    npm ls --global --parseable --long --loglevel info

## Per-Package Config Settings

When running scripts (see `npm-scripts(7)`) the package.json "config"
keys are overwritten in the environment if there is a config param of
`<name>[@<version>]:<key>`.  For example, if the package.json has
this:

    { "name" : "foo"
    , "config" : { "port" : "8080" }
    , "scripts" : { "start" : "node server.js" } }

and the server.js is this:

    http.createServer(...).listen(process.env.npm_package_config_port)

then the user could change the behavior by doing:

    npm config set foo:port 80

See package.json(5) for more information.

## Config Settings

### always-auth

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Force npm to always require authentication when accessing the registry,
even for `GET` requests.

### bin-links

* Default: `true`
* Type: Boolean

Tells npm to create symlinks (or `.cmd` shims on Windows) for package
executables.

Set to false to have it not do this.  This can be used to work around
the fact that some file systems don't support symlinks, even on
ostensibly Unix systems.

### browser

* Default: OS X: `"open"`, Windows: `"start"`, Others: `"xdg-open"`
* Type: String

The browser that is called by the `npm docs` command to open websites.

### ca

* Default: The npm CA certificate
* Type: String or null

The Certificate Authority signing certificate that is trusted for SSL
connections to the registry.

Set to `null` to only allow "known" registrars, or to a specific CA cert
to trust only that specific signing authority.

See also the `strict-ssl` config.

### cache

### cache-max

* Default: Infinity
* Type: Number

The maximum time (in seconds) to keep items in the registry cache before
re-checking against the registry.

Note that no purging is done unless the `npm cache clean` command is
explicitly used, and that only GET requests use the cache.

### cache-min

* Default: 10
* Type: Number

The minimum time (in seconds) to keep items in the registry cache before
re-checking against the registry.

Note that no purging is done unless the `npm cache clean` command is
explicitly used, and that only GET requests use the cache.

### color

* Default: true on Posix, false on Windows
* Type: Boolean or `"always"`

If false, never shows colors.  If `"always"` then always shows colors.
If true, then only prints color codes for tty file descriptors.

### coverage

if they respond to the `npm_config_coverage` environment variable.

### depth

`npm cache ls`.

### description

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Show the description in `npm search`

the current Node.js version.

### force

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Makes various commands more forceful.

* lifecycle script failure does not block progress.
* publishing clobbers previously published versions.
* skips cache when requesting from the registry.
* prevents checks against clobbering non-npm files.

### fetch-retries

* Default: 2
* Type: Number

The "retries" config for the `retry` module to use when fetching

change.  Only the output from `npm ls --json` is currently valid.

### link

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, then local installs will link if there is a suitable globally
installed package.

Note that this means that local installs can cause things to be
installed into the global space at the same time.  The link is only done
if one of the two conditions are met:

* The package is not already installed globally, or

### logstream

* Default: process.stderr
* Type: Stream

This is the stream that is passed to the
[npmlog](https://github.com/isaacs/npmlog) module at run time.

stderr.

If the `color` config is set to true, then this stream will receive
colored output if it is a TTY.

   local `npm install` without any arguments.
2. Set the NODE_ENV="production" for lifecycle scripts.

### proprietary-attribs

bundledDependencies list.

### save-dev

Whether or not to do SSL key validation when making requests to the
registry via https.

See also the `ca` config.

### tag

* Default: latest
* Type: String

it will install the specified tag.

Also the tag that is added to the package@version specified by the `npm
tag` command, if no explicit tag is given.

### tmp

* Type: Octal numeric string

The "umask" value to use when setting the file creation mode on files
and folders.

Folders and executables are given a mode which is `0777` masked against
