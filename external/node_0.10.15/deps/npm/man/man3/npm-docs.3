.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command tries to guess at the likely location of a package\'s
documentation URL, and then tries to open it using the \fB\-\-browser\fR
config param\.
.
.P
Like other commands, the first parameter is an array\. This command only
uses the first element, which is expected to be a package name with an
optional version number\.
.
.P
This command will launch a browser, so this command may not be the most
friendly for programmatic use\.
