Array of search terms\. These terms are case\-insensitive\.

This is the threshold for stale packages\. "Fresh" packages are not refreshed

.

Returns an object where each key is the name of a package, and the value
is information about that package along with a \'words\' property, which is
a space\-delimited string of all of the interesting words in that package\.

.P
A search on the registry excludes any result that does not match all of the
search terms\. It also removes any items from the results that contain an
excluded term (the "searchexclude" config)\. The search is case insensitive
and doesn\'t try to read your mind (it doesn\'t do any verb tense matching or the
like)\.
