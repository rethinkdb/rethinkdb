1.1 07/12/95 - eay
	Many thanks to Rhys Weatherley <rweather@us.oracle.com>
	for pointing out that I was assuming little endian byte
	order for all quantities what idea actually used
	bigendian.  No where in the spec does it mention
	this, it is all in terms of 16 bit numbers and even the example
	does not use byte streams for the input example :-(.
	If you byte swap each pair of input, keys and iv, the functions
	would produce the output as the old version :-(.

1.0 ??/??/95 - eay
	First version.
