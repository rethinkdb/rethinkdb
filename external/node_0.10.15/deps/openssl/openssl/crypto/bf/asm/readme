There are blowfish assembler generation scripts.
bf-586.pl version is for the pentium and
bf-686.pl is my original version, which is faster on the pentium pro.

When using a bf-586.pl, the pentium pro/II is %8 slower than using
bf-686.pl.  When using a bf-686.pl, the pentium is %16 slower
than bf-586.pl

So the default is bf-586.pl
