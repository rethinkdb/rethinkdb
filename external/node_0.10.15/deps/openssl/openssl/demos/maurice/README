	Example programs, demonstrating some basic SSLeay crypto library

	- loadkeys.c 	Demonstrates the loading and of public and 
			private keys.
	- loadkeys.h   	The interface for loadkeys.c
	- example1.c    Demonstrates the sealing and opening API's
	- example2.c  	Demonstrates rsa encryption and decryption
	- example3.c    Demonstrates the use of symmetric block ciphers
	- example4.c	Demonstrates base64 and decoding 		
	- Makefile	A makefile you probably will have to adjust for
			your environment
	- README	this file


	The programs were written by Maurice Gittens <mgittens@gits.nl>
	with the necesary help from Eric Young <eay@cryptsoft.com> 
	
	You may do as you please with these programs, but please don't
	pretend that you wrote them. 

	To be complete: If you use these programs you acknowlegde that
	you are aware that there is NO warranty of any kind associated
	with these programs. I don't even claim that the programs work,
	they are provided AS-IS.
