Scripts for using ECC ciphersuites with test/testssl
(these ciphersuites are described in the Internet Draft available at
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-ecc-03.txt).

Use ECCcertgen.sh, RSAcertgen.sh, ECC-RSAcertgen.sh to generate
root, client and server certs of the following types:

     ECC certs signed with ECDSA
     RSA certs signed with RSA
     ECC certs signed with RSA

Afterwards, you can use ssltest.sh to run the various tests;
specify one of the following options:

     aecdh, ecdh-ecdsa, ecdhe-ecdsa, ecdh-rsa, ecdhe-rsa
