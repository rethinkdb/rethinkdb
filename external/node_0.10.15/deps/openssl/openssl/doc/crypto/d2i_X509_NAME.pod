=head1 NAME

d2i_X509_NAME, i2d_X509_NAME - X509_NAME encoding functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509.h>

 X509_NAME *d2i_X509_NAME(X509_NAME **a, unsigned char **pp, long length);
 int i2d_X509_NAME(X509_NAME *a, unsigned char **pp);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These functions decode and encode an B<X509_NAME> structure which is the
the same as the B<Name> type defined in RFC2459 (and elsewhere) and used
for example in certificate subject and issuer names.

Othewise the functions behave in a similar way to d2i_X509() and i2d_X509()
described in the L<d2i_X509(3)|d2i_X509(3)> manual page.
