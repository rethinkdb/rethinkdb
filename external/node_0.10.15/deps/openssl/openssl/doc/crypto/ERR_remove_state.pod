=head1 NAME

ERR_remove_state - free a thread's error queue

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/err.h>

 void ERR_remove_state(unsigned long pid);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ERR_remove_state() frees the error queue associated with thread B<pid>.
If B<pid> == 0, the current thread will have its error queue removed.

Since error queue data structures are allocated automatically for new
threads, they must be freed when threads are terminated in order to
avoid memory leaks.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

ERR_remove_state() returns no value.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<err(3)|err(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

ERR_remove_state() is available in all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.
