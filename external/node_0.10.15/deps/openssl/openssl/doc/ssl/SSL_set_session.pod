=head1 NAME

SSL_set_session - set a TLS/SSL session to be used during TLS/SSL connect

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 int SSL_set_session(SSL *ssl, SSL_SESSION *session);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_set_session() sets B<session> to be used when the TLS/SSL connection
is to be established. SSL_set_session() is only useful for TLS/SSL clients.
When the session is set, the reference count of B<session> is incremented
by 1. If the session is not reused, the reference count is decremented
again during SSL_connect(). Whether the session was reused can be queried
with the L<SSL_session_reused(3)|SSL_session_reused(3)> call.

If there is already a session set inside B<ssl> (because it was set with
SSL_set_session() before or because the same B<ssl> was already used for
a connection), SSL_SESSION_free() will be called for that session.

=head1 NOTES

SSL_SESSION objects keep internal link information about the session cache
list, when being inserted into one SSL_CTX object's session cache.
One SSL_SESSION object, regardless of its reference count, must therefore
only be used with one SSL_CTX object (and the SSL objects created
from this SSL_CTX object).
