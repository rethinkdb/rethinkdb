TODO:
=====

There are a few things that need to be worked out in the VMS version of
OpenSSL, still:

- Description files. ("Makefile's" :-))
- Script code to link an already compiled build tree.
- A VMSINSTALlable version (way in the future, unless someone else hacks).
- shareable images (DLL for you Windows folks).

There may be other things that I have missed and that may be desirable.
Please send mail to <openssl-users@openssl.org> or to me directly if you
have any ideas.
