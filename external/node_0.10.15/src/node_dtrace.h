 * based on whether the version field's value is a reasonable pointer (i.e.
 * address greater than 4K).  No doubt this is filthy, but there's not much else
 * we can do, and it works reliably.

 * This version of the structure also contains padding that should be zeroed out
 * by the consumer so that future versions of the translator can simply check if
 * a field is present by checking it against NULL.
