Version 0.6.0 will be released next week. Please spend some time this
week upgrading your code to v0.5.10. Report any API differences at <a
href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/API-changes-between-v0.4-and-v0.6">https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/API-changes-between-v0.4-and-v0.6</a>
or report a bug to us at <a
href="http://github.com/joyent/node/issues">http://github.com/joyent/node/issues</a>
if you hit problems.

The API changes between v0.4.12 and v0.5.10 are 99% cosmetic, minor,
and easy to fix. Most people are able to migrate their code in 10
minutes. Don't fear.

Once you've ported your code to v0.5.10 please help out by testing
third party modules. Make bug reports. Encourage authors to publish
new versions of their modules. Go through the list of modules at <a
href="http://npmjs.org/">http://npmjs.org/</a> and try out random
ones. This is especially encouraged of Windows users!
