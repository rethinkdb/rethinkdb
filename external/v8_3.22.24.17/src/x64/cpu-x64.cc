  // own instruction cache updated automatically.

  // API function FlushInstructionCache.

  // By default, valgrind only checks the stack for writes that might need to
  // invalidate already cached translated code.  This leads to random
  // instability when code patches or moves are sometimes unnoticed.  One
  // solution is to run valgrind with --smc-check=all, but this comes at a big
  // performance cost.  We can notify valgrind to invalidate its cache.
