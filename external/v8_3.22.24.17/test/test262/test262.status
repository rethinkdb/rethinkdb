  ######################## NEEDS INVESTIGATION ###########################

  # These test failures are specific to the intl402 suite and need investigation
  # to be either marked as bugs with issues filed for them or as deliberate
  # incompatibilities if the test cases turn out to be broken or ambiguous.

  ##################### DELIBERATE INCOMPATIBILITIES #####################

  # This tests precision of Math functions.  The implementation for those
  # trigonometric functions are platform/compiler dependent.  Furthermore, the
  # expectation values by far deviates from the actual result given by an
  # arbitrary-precision calculator, making those tests partly bogus.

  'S15.8.2.16_A7': [PASS, FAIL_OK],  # Math.sin
  'S15.8.2.18_A7': [PASS, FAIL_OK],  # Math.tan

  # Linux for ia32 (and therefore simulators) default to extended 80 bit
  # floating point formats, so these tests checking 64-bit FP precision fail.
  # The other platforms/arch's pass these tests.
  # We follow the other major JS engines by keeping this default.
