#
# The normalization stabilization policy of the Unicode
# Consortium ordinarily precludes any change to the decomposition
# for any character, once established in a relevant version
# of the UnicodeData.txt data file. However, under certain
# exceptional (and rare) conditions, an error in a decomposition
# mapping may be discovered that is truly just an unintended
# typo in the data, and not a matter of dubious interpretation.
#
# Whenever such an error may be found, and if it meets the
# requirements for possible exceptions to normalization
# stability, the correction is entered in this data file,
# so that any implementation depending on absolute stability
# of normalization, *including* any errors in the data, can
# safely reconstruct the exact state of the data tables at
# any given version of Unicode.
#
# Currently this list has exactly six entries in it, one for the
# typo found and corrected in Corrigendum #3, and five for
# the typos and misidentifications found and corrected in 
# Corrigendum #4. All efforts
# will be made to keep the entries limited to just those fixes.
#
# Interpretation of the fields:
#   Field 0: Unicode code point
#   Field 1: Original (erroneous) decomposition
#   Field 2: Corrected decomposition
#   Field 3: Version of Unicode for which the correction was
#            entered into UnicodeData.txt, in n.n.n format.
#   Comment: Indicates the Unicode Corrigendum which documents 
#            the correction
