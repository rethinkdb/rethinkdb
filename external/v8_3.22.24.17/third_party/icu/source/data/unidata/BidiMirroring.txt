# Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph Property
# 
# This file is an informative contributory data file in the
# Unicode Character Database.
#
# Copyright (c) 1991-2010 Unicode, Inc.
# For terms of use, see http://www.unicode.org/terms_of_use.html
#
# This data file lists characters that have the Bidi_Mirrored=True property
# value, for which there is another Unicode character that typically has a glyph
# that is the mirror image of the original character's glyph.
#
# The repertoire covered by the file is Unicode 6.0.0.
# 
# The file contains a list of lines with mappings from one code point
# to another one for character-based mirroring.
# Note that for "real" mirroring, a rendering engine needs to select
# appropriate alternative glyphs, and that many Unicode characters do not
# have a mirror-image Unicode character.
# 
# Each mapping line contains two fields, separated by a semicolon (';').
# Each of the two fields contains a code point represented as a
# variable-length hexadecimal value with 4 to 6 digits.
# A comment indicates where the characters are "BEST FIT" mirroring.
# 
# Code points for which Bidi_Mirrored=True, but for which no appropriate 
# characters exist with mirrored glyphs, are
# listed as comments at the end of the file.
#
# Formally, the default value of the Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph property
# for each code point is the code point itself, unless a mapping to
# some other character is specified in this data file. When a code
# point has the default value for the Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph property,
# that means that no other character exists whose glyph is suitable
# for character-based mirroring.
# 
# For information on bidi mirroring, see UAX #9: Bidirectional Algorithm,
# at http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr9/
