.SH DESCRIPTION
.B genrb
converts the resource
.I bundle
source files passed on the command line to their binary form or to
a Java source file for use with ICU4J.
The resulting binary files have a
.B .res
extension while resource bundle source files typically have a 
.B .txt
extension. Java source files have a
.B java
extension and follow the ICU4J naming conventions.
.PP
It is customary to name the resource bundles by their locale name,
i.e. to use a local identifier for the
.I bundle
filename, e.g.
.B ja_JP.txt
for Japanese (Japan) data, or
.B root.txt
for the root bundle.
In any case,
.B genrb
will produce a file whose base name is the name of the locale found
in the resource file, not the base name of the resource file itself.
.PP
The binary files can be read directly by ICU, or used by
.BR pkgdata (1)
for incorporation into a larger archive or library.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-h\fP, \fB\-?\fP, \fB\-\-help"
Print help about usage and exit.
.TP
.BR "\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version"
Print the version of
.B genrb
and exit.
.TP
.BR "\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose"
Display extra informative messages during execution.
.TP
.BI "\-e\fP, \fB\-\-encoding" " encoding"
Set the encoding used to read input files to
.IR encoding .
The default encoding is the invariant (subset of ASCII or EBCDIC)
codepage for the system (see section
.BR "INVARIANT CHARACTERS" ).
The encodings UTF-8, UTF-16BE, and UTF-16LE are automatically detected
if a byte order mark (BOM) is present.
.TP
.BI "\-j\fP, \fB\-\-write\-java" " \fR[ \fPencoding\fR ]\fP"
Generate a Java source code for use with ICU4J. An optional
.I encoding
for the Java file can be given.
.TP
.BI "\-s\fP, \fB\-\-sourcedir" " source"
Set the source directory to
.IR source .
The default source directory is specified by the environment variable
.BR ICU_DATA ,
or the location set when ICU was built if 
.B ICU_DATA
is not set.
.TP
.BI "\-d\fP, \fB\-\-destdir" " destination"
Set the destination directory to
.IR destination .
The default destination directory is specified by the environment variable
.BR ICU_DATA
or is the location set when ICU was built if 
.B ICU_DATA
is not set.
.TP
.BI "\-i\fP, \fB\-\-icudatadir" " directory"
Look for any necessary ICU data files in
.IR directory .
For example, when processing collation overrides, the file
.B ucadata.dat
must be located.
The default ICU data directory is specified by the environment variable
.BR ICU_DATA .
.SH INVARIANT CHARACTERS
The
.B invariant character set
consists of the following set of characters, expressed as a standard POSIX
regular expression:
.BR "[a-z]|[A-Z]|[0-9]|_| |+|-|*|/" .
This is the set which is guaranteed to be available regardless of code page.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 10
.B ICU_DATA
Specifies the directory containing ICU data. Defaults to
.BR @thepkgicudatadir@/@PACKAGE@/@VERSION@/ .
Some tools in ICU depend on the presence of the trailing slash. It is thus
important to make sure that it is present if
.B ICU_DATA
is set.
