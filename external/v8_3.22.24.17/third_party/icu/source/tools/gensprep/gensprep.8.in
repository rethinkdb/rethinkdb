.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gensprep
reads filtered RFC 3454 files and compiles their

The resulting file,
.BR <name>.icu ,
can then be read directly by ICU, or used by
.BR pkgdata (8)
for incorporation into a larger archive or library.
.LP
The files read by
.B gensprep
are described in the
.B FILES
section.
