.SH DESCRIPTION
.B genctd
reads the word list from
.I dictionary-file
and creates a compact trie dictionary file. Normally this data file has the 
.B .ctd
extension.
.PP
Words begin at the beginning of a line and are terminated by the first whitespace.
Lines that begin with whitespace are ignored.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-h\fP, \fB\-?\fP, \fB\-\-help"
Print help about usage and exit.
.TP
.BR "\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version"
Print the version of
.B genctd
and exit.
.TP
.BR "\-c\fP, \fB\-\-copyright"
Embeds the standard ICU copyright into the
.IR output-file .
.TP
.BR "\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose"
Display extra informative messages during execution.
.TP
.BI "\-d\fP, \fB\-\-destdir" " destination"
Set the destination directory of the
.IR output-file
to
.IR destination .
.TP
.BI "\-i\fP, \fB\-\-icudatadir" " directory"
Look for any necessary ICU data files in
.IR directory .
For example, the file
.B pnames.icu
must be located when ICU's data is not built as a shared library.
The default ICU data directory is specified by the environment variable
.BR ICU_DATA .
Most configurations of ICU do not require this argument.
.TP
.BI " dictionary\-file"
The source file to read.
.TP
.BI "\-o\fP, \fB\-\-out" " output\-file"
The output data file to write.
.SH CAVEATS
When the
.IR dictionary-file
contains a byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the file, which is the Unicode character
.B U+FEFF,
then the
.IR dictionary-file
is interpreted as Unicode. Without the BOM,
the file is interpreted in the current operating system default codepage.
In order to eliminate any ambiguity of the encoding for how the
.IR rule-file
was written, it is recommended that you write this file in UTF-8
with the BOM.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 10
.B ICU_DATA
Specifies the directory containing ICU data. Defaults to
.BR @thepkgicudatadir@/@PACKAGE@/@VERSION@/ .
Some tools in ICU depend on the presence of the trailing slash. It is thus
important to make sure that it is present if
.B ICU_DATA
is set.
