 * \brief Logging library core class
 *
 * The logging core is used to interconnect log sources and sinks. It also provides
 * a number of basic features, like global filtering and global and thread-specific attribute storage.
 *
 * The logging core is a singleton. Users can acquire the core instance by calling the static method <tt>get</tt>.
