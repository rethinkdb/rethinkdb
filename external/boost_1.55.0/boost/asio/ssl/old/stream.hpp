/**
 * The stream class template provides asynchronous and blocking stream-oriented
 * functionality using SSL.
 *
 * @par Thread Safety
 * @e Distinct @e objects: Safe.@n
 * @e Shared @e objects: Unsafe.
 *
 * @par Example
 * To use the SSL stream template with an ip::tcp::socket, you would write:
 * @code
 * boost::asio::io_service io_service;
 * boost::asio::ssl::context context(io_service, boost::asio::ssl::context::sslv23);
 * boost::asio::ssl::stream<boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket> sock(io_service, context);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Concepts:
 * AsyncReadStream, AsyncWriteStream, Stream, SyncRead_Stream, SyncWriteStream.
