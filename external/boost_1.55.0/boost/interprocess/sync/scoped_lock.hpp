//!scoped_lock is meant to carry out the tasks for locking, unlocking, try-locking
//!and timed-locking (recursive or not) for the Mutex. The Mutex need not supply all
//!of this functionality. If the client of scoped_lock<Mutex> does not use
//!functionality which the Mutex does not supply, no harm is done. Mutex ownership
//!transfer is supported through the syntax of move semantics. Ownership transfer
//!is allowed both by construction and assignment. The scoped_lock does not support
//!copy semantics. A compile time error results if copy construction or copy
//!assignment is attempted. Mutex ownership can also be moved from an
//!upgradable_lock and sharable_lock via constructor. In this role, scoped_lock
//!shares the same functionality as a write_lock.
