//!sharable_lock is meant to carry out the tasks for sharable-locking
//!(such as read-locking), unlocking, try-sharable-locking and timed-sharable-locking
//!(recursive or not) for the Mutex. The Mutex need not supply all of this
//!functionality. If the client of sharable_lock<Mutex> does not use functionality which
//!the Mutex does not supply, no harm is done. Mutex ownership can be shared among
//!sharable_locks, and a single upgradable_lock. sharable_lock does not support
//!copy semantics. But sharable_lock supports ownership transfer from an sharable_lock,
//!upgradable_lock and scoped_lock via transfer_lock syntax.*/
