/**
 * Placeholders are used heavily throughout the library.
 * Every placeholder must derive from @ref placeholder.
 * The library provides a number of placeholders,
 * out of the box, but you are welcome to define your own,
 * if you want more descriptive names.  The placeholder
 * @ref _self is special in that it is used as the default
 * wherever possible.
 *
 * What exactly is a placeholder?  Placeholders act as
 * a substitute for template parameters in concepts.
 * The library automatically replaces all the placeholders
 * used in a concept with the actual types involved when
 * it stores an object in an @ref any.
 *
 * For example, in the following,
 *
 * @code
 * any<copy_constructible<_a>, _a> x(1);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The library sees that we're constructing an @ref any
 * that uses the @ref _a placeholder with an @c int.
 * Thus it binds @ref _a to int and instantiates
 * @ref copy_constructible "copy_constructible<int>".
 *
 * When there are multiple placeholders involved, you
 * will have to use @ref tuple, or pass the bindings
 * explicitly, but the substitution still works the
 * same way.

 * by most concepts, so using concepts with no
 * explicit arguments will "just work" as much as
 * possible.
