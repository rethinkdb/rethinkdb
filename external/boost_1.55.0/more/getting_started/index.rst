Welcome
-------

Welcome to the Boost libraries!  By the time you've completed this
tutorial, you'll be at least somewhat comfortable with the contents
of a Boost distribution and how to go about using it.  

What's Here
-----------

This document is designed to be an *extremely* gentle introduction,
so we included a fair amount of material that may already be very
familiar to you.  To keep things simple, we also left out some
information intermediate and advanced users will probably want.  At
the end of this document, we'll refer you on to resources that can
help you pursue these topics further.

Preliminaries
-------------

We use one typographic convention that might not be immediately
obvious: *italic* text in examples is meant as a descriptive
placeholder for something else, usually information that you'll
provide.  For example:

.. parsed-literal::

   **$** echo "My name is *your name*\ "

Here you're expected to imagine replacing the text “your name” with
your actual name.

Ready?
------

Let's go!
