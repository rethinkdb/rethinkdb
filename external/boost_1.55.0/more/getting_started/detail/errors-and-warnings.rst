Errors and Warnings
-------------------

Don't be alarmed if you see compiler warnings originating in Boost
headers.  We try to eliminate them, but doing so isn't always
practical.  [#warnings]_ **Errors are another matter**.  If you're
seeing compilation errors at this point in the tutorial, check to
be sure you've copied the `example program`__ correctly and that you've
correctly identified the `Boost root directory`_.
