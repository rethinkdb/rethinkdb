<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">connected_components()</span></tt> function computes the connected
components of an undirected graph.  The distributed connected
components algorithm uses the sequential version of the connected
components algorithm to compute the connected components of the local
subgraph, then executes the parallel phase of the algorithm.  The
parallel portion of the connected components algorithm is loosely
based on the work of Goddard, Kumar, and Prins. The interface is a
superset of the interface to the BGL <a class="reference external" href="http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/connected_components.html">sequential connected
components</a> algorithm.</p>
<p>Prior to executing the sequential phase of the algorithm, each process
identifies the roots of its local components.  An adjacency list of
all vertices adjacent to members of the component is then constructed
at the root vertex of each component.</p>
<p>The parallel phase of the distributed connected components algorithm
consists of a series of supersteps.  In each superstep, each root
attempts to hook to a member of it's adjacency list by assigning it's
parent pointer to that vertex.  Hooking is restricted to vertices
which are logically less than the current vertex to prevent looping.
Vertices which hook successfully are removed from the list of roots
and placed on another list of completed vertices.  All completed
vertices now execute a pointer jumping step until every completed
vertex has as its parent the root of a component.  This pointer
jumping step may be further optimized by the addition of Cycle
Reduction (CR) rules developed by Johnson and Metaxas, however current
performance evaluations indicate that this would have a negligible
impact on the overall performance of the algorithm.  These CR rules
reduce the number of pointer jumping steps from <em>O(n)</em> to <em>O(log n)</em>.
Following this pointer jumping step, roots which have hooked in this
phase transmit their adjacency list to their new parent.  The
remaining roots receive these edges and execute a pruning step on
their adjacency lists to remove vertices that are now members of their
component.  The parallel phase of the algorithm is complete when no
root successfully hooks.  Once the parallel phase is complete a final
pointer jumping step is performed on all vertices to assign the parent
pointers of the leaves of the initial local subgraph components to
their final parent which has now been determined.</p>
<p>The single largest performance bottleneck in the distributed connected
components algorithm is the effect of poor vertex distribution on the
algorithm.  For sparse graphs with a single large component, many
roots may hook to the same component, resulting in severe load
imbalance at the process owning this component.  Several methods of
modifying the hooking strategy to avoid this behavior have been
implemented but none has been successful as of yet.</p>

<p>The local phase of the algorithm is <em>O(V + E)</em>.  The parallel phase of
the algorithm requires at most <em>O(d)</em> supersteps where <em>d</em> is the
number of initial roots.  <em>d</em> is at most <em>O(V)</em> but becomes
significantly smaller as <em>E</em> increases.  The pointer jumping phase
within each superstep requires at most <em>O(c)</em> steps on each of the
completed roots where <em>c</em> is the length of the longest cycle.
Application of CR rules can reduce this to <em>O(log c)</em>.</p>

<p>The following charts illustrate the performance of the Parallel BGL
connected components algorithm. It performs well on very sparse and
very dense graphs. However, for cases where the graph has a medium
density with a giant connected component, the algorithm will perform
poorly. This is a known problem with the algorithm and as far as we
know all implemented algorithms have this degenerate behavior.</p>
