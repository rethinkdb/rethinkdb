[section Change log]

This section summarizes significant changes to the Fusion library.

* Sep 27, 2006: Added `boost::tuple` support. (Joel de Guzman)
* Nov 17, 2006: Added `boost::variant` support. (Joel de Guzman)
* Feb 15, 2007: Added functional module. (Tobias Schwinger)
* April 2, 2007: Added struct adapter. (Joel de Guzman)
* May 8, 2007: Added associative struct adapter. (Dan Marsden)
* Dec 20, 2007: Removed `boost::variant` support. After thorough
  investigation, I think now that the move to make variant a
  fusion sequence is rather quirky. A variant will always
  have a size==1 regardless of the number of types it can contain
  and there's no way to know at compile time what it contains.
  Iterating over its types is simply wrong. All these imply that
  the variant is *not* a fusion sequence. (Joel de Guzman)
* Oct 12, 2009: The accumulator is the first argument to the functor of
  __fold__ and __accumulate__. (Christopher Schmidt)
* Oct 30, 2009: Added support for associative iterators and views. (Christopher
  Schmidt)
* March 1, 2010: Added __adapt_struct_named__ and __adapt_struct_named_ns__
  (Hartmut Kaiser)
* April 4, 2010: Added __array__ support, __adapt_tpl_struct__,
  __adapt_assoc_tpl_struct__, __adapt_assoc_struct_named__ and
  __adapt_assoc_struct_named_ns__ (Christopher Schmidt)
* April 5, 2010: Added __define_struct__, __define_tpl_struct__,
  __define_assoc_struct__ and __define_assoc_tpl_struct__ (Christopher Schmidt)
* June 18, 2010: Added __reverse_fold__, __iter_fold__ and __reverse_iter_fold__
  (Christopher Schmidt)
* October 7, 2010: Added __adapt_adt__, __adapt_tpl_adt__,
  __adapt_assoc_adt__ and __adapt_assoc_tpl_adt__ (Joel de Guzman,
  Hartmut Kaiser and Christopher Schmidt)
* August 29, 2011: Added support for segmented sequences and iterators (Eric Niebler)
* September 16, 2011: Added preprocessed files (using wave) to speed up
  compilation (Joel de Guzman)
* October 8, 2011: Added adaptor for std::tuple (Joel de Guzman)
