    <title>Environment</title>
    <section>
        <title>Build</title>
        <para>
            The whole library is provided in headers. Regex variants of some algorithms, 
            however, are dependent on the <libraryname>Boost.Regex</libraryname> library. All such algorithms are
            separated in <headername>boost/algorithm/string_regex.hpp</headername>. 
            If this header is used, the application must be linked with the <libraryname>Boost.Regex</libraryname> 
            library. 
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Examples</title>
        <para>
            Examples showing the basic usage of the library can be found in the libs/algorithm/string/example
            directory. There is a separate file for the each part of the library. Please follow the boost
            build guidelines to build examples using the bjam. To successfully build regex examples 
            the <libraryname>Boost.Regex</libraryname> library is required. 
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Tests</title>
        <para>
            A full set of test cases for the library is located in the libs/algorithm/string/test directory. 
            The test cases can be executed using the boost build system. For the tests of regular 
            expression variants of algorithms, the <libraryname>Boost.Regex</libraryname> library is required. 
        </para>

    <section>
        <title>Portability</title>
        <para>
            The library has been successfully compiled and tested with the following compilers:
            
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>Microsoft Visual C++ 7.0</listitem>
                <listitem>Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1</listitem>
                <listitem>GCC 3.2</listitem>
                <listitem>GCC 3.3.1</listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            See <ulink url="http://boost.sourceforge.net/regression-logs/">Boost regression tables</ulink>
            for additional info for a particular compiler.
        </para>
        <para>
            There are known limitation on platforms not supporting partial template specialization. 
            Library depends on correctly implemented <code>std::iterator_traits</code> class. 
            If a standard library provided with compiler is broken, the String Algorithm Library 
            cannot function properly. Usually it implies that primitive pointer iterators are not 
            working with the library functions.
