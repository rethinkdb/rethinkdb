This back-end contains the library
                    engine and defines the performance and functionality trade-offs. The currently
                    available back-end implements most of the functionality defined by the UML 2.0
                    standard at very high runtime speed, in exchange for longer compile-time. The
                    runtime speed is due to a constant-time double-dispatch and self-adapting
                    capabilities allowing the framework to adapt itself to the features used by a
                    given concrete state machine. All unneeded features either disable themselves or
                    can be manually disabled. See section 5.1 for a complete description of the
                    run-to-completion algorithm.</p><div class="sect2" title="Creation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2303"></a>Creation </h3></div></div></div><p>MSM being divided between front and back-end, one needs to first define a
                        front-end. Then, to create a real state machine, the back-end must be
                        declared:
                        </p><pre class="programlisting">typedef msm::back::state_machine&lt;my_front_end&gt; my_fsm;</pre><p>We now have a fully functional state machine type. The next sections will

                        activate the initial state, which means in turn that the initial state's
                        entry behavior will be called. We need the start method because you do not
                        always want the entry behavior of the initial state to be called immediately
                        but only when your state machine is ready to process events. A good example
                        of this is when you use a state machine to write an algorithm and each loop
                        back to the initial state is an algorithm call. Each call to start will make
                        the algorithm run once. The <a class="link" href="examples/iPodSearch.cpp" target="_top">iPodSearch</a> example uses this possibility.</p><p>The <code class="code">stop()</code> method works the same way. It will cause the exit
                        actions of the currently active states(s) to be called.</p><p>Both methods are actually not an absolute need. Not calling them will
                        simply cause your first entry or your last exit action not to be
                        called.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Event dispatching"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2331"></a>Event dispatching</h3></div></div></div><p>The main reason to exist for a state machine is to dispatch events. For
                        MSM, events are objects of a given event type. The object itself can contain
                        data, but the event type is what decides of the transition to be taken. For
                        MSM, if some_event is a given type (a simple struct for example) and e1 and
                        e2 concrete instances of some_event, e1 and e2 are equivalent, from a
                        transition perspective. Of course, e1 and e2 can have different values and
                        you can use them inside actions. Events are dispatched as const reference,
                        so actions cannot modify events for obvious side-effect reasons. To dispatch
                        an event of type some_event, you can simply create one on the fly or
                        instantiate if before processing: </p><pre class="programlisting">my_fsm fsm; fsm.process_event(some_event());
some_event e1; fsm.process_event(e1)</pre><p>Creating an event on the fly will be optimized by the compiler so the
                        performance will not degrade.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Active state(s)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2340"></a>Active state(s)</h3></div></div></div><p>The backend also offers a way to know which state is active, though you
                        will normally only need this for debugging purposes. If what you need simply
                        is doing something with the active state, <span class="command"><strong><a class="command" href="ch02s02.html#UML-internal-transition">internal transitions</a></strong></span> or
                            <span class="command"><strong><a class="command" href="ch03s05.html#backend-visitor">visitors</a></strong></span> are a better
                        alternative. If you need to know what state is active, const int*
                        current_state() will return an array of state ids. Please refer to the
                            <span class="command"><strong><a class="command" href="ch06s03.html#internals-state-id">internals section</a></strong></span> to
                        know how state ids are generated.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Serialization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2354"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="back-end-serialization"></a></strong></span>Serialization</h3></div></div></div><p>A common need is the ability to save a state machine and restore it at a
                        different time. MSM supports this feature for the basic and functor
                        front-ends, and in a more limited manner for eUML. MSM supports
                        boost::serialization out of the box (by offering a <code class="code">serialize</code>
                        function). Actually, for basic serialization, you need not do much, a MSM
                        state machine is serializable almost like any other type. Without any
                        special work, you can make a state machine remember its state, for
                        example:</p><p>
                        </p><pre class="programlisting">MyFsm fsm;
// write to archive
std::ofstream ofs("fsm.txt");
// save fsm to archive
{
    boost::archive::text_oarchive oa(ofs);
    // write class instance to archive
    oa &lt;&lt; fsm;
}                                                  </pre><p>
                    </p><p>Loading back is very similar:</p><p>
                        </p><pre class="programlisting">MyFsm fsm;
{
    // create and open an archive for input
    std::ifstream ifs("fsm.txt");
    boost::archive::text_iarchive ia(ifs);
    // read class state from archive
    ia &gt;&gt; fsm;
}                                          </pre><p>
                    </p><p>This will (de)serialize the state machine itself but not the concrete
                        states' data. This can be done on a per-state basis to reduce the amount of
                        typing necessary. To allow serialization of a concrete state, provide a
                        do_serialize typedef and implement the serialize function:</p><p>
                        </p><pre class="programlisting">struct Empty : public msm::front::state&lt;&gt; 
{
    // we want Empty to be serialized. First provide the typedef
    typedef int do_serialize;
    // then implement serialize
    template&lt;class Archive&gt;
    void serialize(Archive &amp; ar, const unsigned int /* version */)
    {
        ar &amp; some_dummy_data;
    }
    Empty():some_dummy_data(0){}           
    int some_dummy_data;
};                        </pre><p>
                    </p><p>You can also serialize data contained in the front-end class. Again, you
                        need to provide the typedef and implement serialize:</p><p>
                        </p><pre class="programlisting">struct player_ : public msm::front::state_machine_def&lt;player_&gt;
{
    //we might want to serialize some data contained by the front-end
    int front_end_data;
    player_():front_end_data(0){}
    // to achieve this, provide the typedef
    typedef int do_serialize;
    // and implement serialize
    template&lt;class Archive&gt;
    void serialize(Archive &amp; ar, const unsigned int )
    {
        ar &amp; front_end_data;
    }  
...
};                                               </pre><p>
                    </p><p>The saving of the back-end data (the current state(s)) is valid for all
                        front-ends, so a front-end written using eUML can be serialized. However, to
                        serialize a concrete state, the macros like
                            <code class="code">BOOST_MSM_EUML_STATE</code> cannot be used, so the state will have
                        to be implemented by directly inheriting from
                            <code class="code">front::euml::euml_state</code>.</p><p>The only limitiation is that the event queues cannot be serialized so
                        serializing must be done in a stable state, when no event is being
                        processed. You can serialize during event processing only if using no queue
                        (deferred or event queue).</p><p>This <a class="link" href="examples/Serialize.cpp" target="_top">example</a> shows a state machine which we serialize after processing an
                        event. The <code class="code">Empty</code> state also has some data to serialize.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Base state type"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2407"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="backend-base-state"></a></strong></span>Base state type </h3></div></div></div><p>Sometimes, one needs to customize states to avoid repetition and provide a
                        common functionality, for example in the form of a virtual method. You might
                        also want to make your states polymorphic so that you can call typeid on
                        them for logging or debugging. It is also useful if you need a visitor, like
                        the next section will show. You will notice that all front-ends offer the
                        possibility of adding a base type. Note that all states and state machines
                        must have the same base state, so this could reduce reuse. For example,
                        using the basic front end, you need to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Add the non-default base state in your msm::front::state&lt;&gt;
                                    definition, as first template argument (except for
                                    interrupt_states for which it is the second argument, the first
                                    one being the event ending the interrupt), for example,
                                    my_base_state being your new base state for all states in a
                                    given state machine:
                                    </p><pre class="programlisting">struct Empty : public msm::front::state&lt;my_base_state&gt;</pre><p>
                                    Now, my_base_state is your new base state. If it has a virtual
                                    function, your states become polymorphic. MSM also provides a
                                    default polymorphic base type,
                                        <code class="code">msm::front::polymorphic_state</code>
                                </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Add the user-defined base state in the state machine frontend
                                    definition, as a second template argument, for example:

                        from current_state()) using <code class="code">const base_state* get_state_by_id(int id)
                            const</code> where base_state is the one you just defined. You can now
                        do something polymorphically.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Visitor"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2433"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="backend-visitor"></a></strong></span>Visitor</h3></div></div></div><p>In some cases, having a pointer-to-base of the currently active states is
                        not enough. You might want to call non-virtually a method of the currently
                        active states. It will not be said that MSM forces the virtual keyword down
                        your throat!</p><p>To achieve this goal, MSM provides its own variation of a visitor pattern
                        using the previously described user-defined state technique. If you add to
                        your user-defined base state an <code class="code">accept_sig</code> typedef giving the
                        return value (unused for the moment) and parameters and provide an accept
                        method with this signature, calling visit_current_states will cause accept
                        to be called on the currently active states. Typically, you will also want
                        to provide an empty default accept in your base state in order in order not
                        to force all your states to implement accept. For example your base state
                        could be:</p><pre class="programlisting">struct my_visitable_state
{
   // signature of the accept function
   typedef args&lt;void&gt; accept_sig;
   // we also want polymorphic states
   virtual ~my_visitable_state() {}
   // default implementation for states who do not need to be visited
   void accept() const {}
};</pre><p>This makes your states polymorphic and visitable. In this case, accept is
                        made const and takes no argument. It could also be:</p><pre class="programlisting">struct SomeVisitor {&#8230;};
struct my_visitable_state
{
    // signature of the accept function
    typedef args&lt;void,SomeVisitor&amp;&gt; accept_sig;
    // we also want polymorphic states
    virtual ~my_visitable_state() {}
    // default implementation for states who do not need to be visited
    void accept(SomeVisitor&amp;) const {}
};</pre><p>And now, <code class="code">accept</code> will take one argument (it could also be
                        non-const). By default, <code class="code">accept</code> takes up to 2 arguments. To get
                        more, set #define BOOST_MSM_VISITOR_ARG_SIZE to another value before
                        including state_machine.hpp. For example:</p><pre class="programlisting">#define BOOST_MSM_VISITOR_ARG_SIZE 3
#include &lt;boost/msm/back/state_machine.hpp&gt;</pre><p>Note that accept will be called on ALL active states <span class="underline">and also automatically on sub-states of a
                            submachine</span>.</p><p><span class="underline">Important warning</span>: The method
                        visit_current_states takes its parameter by value, so if the signature of
                        the accept function is to contain a parameter passed by reference, pass this
                        parameter with a boost:ref/cref to avoid undesired copies or slicing. So,
                        for example, in the above case, call:</p><pre class="programlisting">SomeVisitor vis; sm.visit_current_states(boost::ref(vis));</pre><p>This <a class="link" href="examples/SM-2Arg.cpp" target="_top">example</a> uses a

                        need sometimes to get information about any state, even inactive ones. An
                        example is if you want to write a coverage tool and know how many times a
                        state was visited. To get a state, use the get_state method giving the state
                        name, for example: </p><pre class="programlisting">player::Stopped* tempstate = p.get_state&lt;player::Stopped*&gt;();</pre><p> or </p><pre class="programlisting">player::Stopped&amp; tempstate2 = p.get_state&lt;player::Stopped&amp;&gt;();</pre><p>depending on your personal taste. </p></div><div class="sect2" title="State machine constructor with arguments"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2502"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="backend-fsm-constructor-args"></a></strong></span> State machine constructor with arguments </h3></div></div></div><p>You might want to define a state machine with a non-default constructor.

                        however cases where you might not want this. An example is when you use a
                        state machine as submachine, and this submachine used the above defined
                        constructors. You can add as first argument of the state machine constructor
                        an expression where existing states are passed and copied:</p><pre class="programlisting">player p( back::states_ &lt;&lt; state_1 &lt;&lt; ... &lt;&lt; state_n , boost::ref(data),3);</pre><p>Where state_1..n are instances of some or all of the states of the state
                        machine. Submachines being state machines, this can recurse, for example, if
                        Playing is a submachine containing a state Song1 having itself a constructor
                        where some data is passed:</p><pre class="programlisting">player p( back::states_ &lt;&lt; Playing(back::states_ &lt;&lt; Song1(some_Song1_data)) , 
          boost::ref(data),3);</pre><p>It is also possible to replace a given state by a new instance at any time
                        using <code class="code">set_states()</code> and the same syntax, for example:
                        </p><pre class="programlisting">p.set_states( back::states_ &lt;&lt; state_1 &lt;&lt; ... &lt;&lt; state_n );</pre><p>An <a class="link" href="examples/Constructor.cpp" target="_top">example</a> making intensive use of this capability is provided.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Trading run-time speed for better compile-time / multi-TU compilation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2542"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="backend-tradeof-rt-ct"></a></strong></span>Trading run-time speed for

                        This can become a problem with older compilers and big state machines,
                        especially if you don't really care about run-time speed that much and would
                        be satisfied by a performance roughly the same as most state machine
                        libraries. MSM offers a back-end policy to help there. But before you try
                        it, if you are using a VC compiler, deactivate the /Gm compiler option
                        (default for debug builds). This option can cause builds to be 3 times
                        longer... If the compile-time still is a problem, read further. MSM offers a
                        policy which will speed up compiling in two main cases:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>many transition conflicts</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>submachines</p></li></ul></div><p>The back-end <code class="code">msm::back::state_machine</code> has a policy argument

                        time. Should this be a problem, MSM offers an alternative based on
                        boost::circular_buffer. The policy is msm::back::queue_container_circular.
                        To use it, you need to provide it to the back-end definition:</p><pre class="programlisting"> typedef msm::back::state_machine&lt; player_,msm::back::queue_container_circular&gt; player;           </pre><p>You can access the queues with get_message_queue and get_deferred_queue,
                        both returning a reference or a const reference to the queues themselves.
                        Boost::circular_buffer is outside of the scope of this documentation. What
                        you will however need to define is the queue capacity (initially is 0) to
                        what you think your queue will at most grow, for example (size 1 is

                        transition fires, at which exact point is the target state the new active
                        state of a state machine? At the end of the transition? After the source
                        state has been left? What if an exception is thrown? The Standard considers
                        that run-to-completion means a transition completes in almost no time. But
                        even this can be in some conditions a very very long time. Consider the
                        following example. We have a state machine representing a network
                        connection. We can be <code class="code">Connected</code> and <code class="code">Disconnected</code>. When we move from one
                        state to another, we send a (Boost) Signal to another entity. By default,
                        MSM makes the target state as the new state after the transition is
                        completed. We want to send a signal based on a flag is_connected which is
                        true when in state Connected.</p><p>We are in state <code class="code">Disconnected</code> and receive an event <code class="code">connect</code>. The transition
                        action will ask the state machine <code class="code">is_flag_active&lt;is_connected&gt;</code> and will
                        get... false because we are still in <code class="code">Disconnected</code>. Hmm, what to do? We could
                        queue the action and execute it later, but it means an extra queue, more
                        work and higher run-time.</p><p>MSM provides the possibility (in form of a policy) for a front-end to
                        decide when the target state becomes active. It can be:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>before the transition fires, if the guard will allow the
