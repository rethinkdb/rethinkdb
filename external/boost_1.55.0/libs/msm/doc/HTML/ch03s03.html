It is more
                    powerful than the standard front-end and has a more readable transition table.
                    It also makes it easier to reuse parts of state machines. Like <span class="command"><strong><a class="command" href="ch03s04.html#eUML-front-end">eUML</a></strong></span>, it also comes with a good deal
                    of predefined actions. Actually, eUML generates a functor front-end through
                    Boost.Typeof and Boost.Proto so both offer the same functionality.</p><p>The rows which MSM offered in the previous front-end come in different
                    flavors. We saw the a_row, g_row, _row, row, not counting internal rows. This is
                    already much to know, so why define new rows? These types have some
                    disadvantages: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>They are more typing and information than we would wish. This

                        </pre><p>Transitions are now of type "Row" with exactly 5 template arguments:
                        source state, event, target state, action and guard. Wherever there is
                        nothing (for example actions and guards), write "none". Actions and guards
                        are no more methods but functors getting as arguments the detected event,
                        the state machine, source and target state:</p><pre class="programlisting">struct store_cd_info 
{ 
    template &lt;class Fsm,class Evt,class SourceState,class TargetState&gt; 
    void operator()(Evt const&amp;, Fsm&amp; fsm, SourceState&amp;,TargetState&amp; ) 
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "player::store_cd_info" &lt;&lt; endl;
        fsm.process_event(play());
    } 
}; </pre><p>The advantage of functors compared to functions are that functors are
                        generic and reusable. They also allow passing more parameters than just
                        events. The guard functors are the same but have an operator() returning a
                        bool.</p><p>It is also possible to mix rows from different front-ends. To show this, a
                        g_row has been left in the transition table. <span class="underline">Note:</span> in case the action functor is used in the transition
                        table of a state machine contained inside a top-level state machine, the
                        &#8220;fsm&#8221; parameter refers to the lowest-level state machine (referencing this
                        action), not the top-level one.</p><p>To illustrate the reusable point, MSM comes with a whole set of predefined
                        functors. Please refer to eUML for the <a class="link" href="pt02.html#Reference-begin">full list</a>. For example, we are now going to replace the first
                        action by an action sequence and the guard by a more complex functor.</p><p>We decide we now want to execute two actions in the first transition
                        (Stopped -&gt; Playing). We only need to change the action start_playback to
                        </p><pre class="programlisting">ActionSequence_&lt; mpl::vector&lt;some_action, start_playback&gt; &gt;</pre><p>and
                        now will execute some_action and start_playback every time the transition is
                        taken. ActionSequence_ is a functor calling each action of the mpl::vector
                        in sequence.</p><p>We also want to replace good_disk_format by a condition of the type:
                        &#8220;good_disk_format &amp;&amp; (some_condition || some_other_condition)&#8221;. We
                        can achieve this using And_ and Or_ functors:
                        </p><pre class="programlisting">And_&lt;good_disk_format,Or_&lt; some_condition , some_other_condition&gt; &gt;</pre><p>It
                        even starts looking like functional programming. MSM ships with functors for
                        operators, state machine usage, STL algorithms or container methods.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Defining states with entry/exit actions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1281"></a>Defining states with entry/exit actions</h3></div></div></div><p>You probably noticed that we just showed a different transition table and
                        that we even mixed rows from different front-ends. This means that you can
                        do this and leave the definitions for states unchanged. Most examples are
                        doing this as it is the simplest solution. You still enjoy the simplicity of
                        the first front-end with the extended power of the new transition types.
                        This <a class="link" href="examples/SimpleWithFunctors.cpp" target="_top">tutorial</a>,
                        adapted from the earlier example does just this.</p><p>Of course, it is also possible to define states where entry and exit
                        actions are also provided as functors as these are generated by eUML and
                        both front-ends are equivalent. For example, we can define a state
                        as:</p><pre class="programlisting">struct Empty_Entry 
{ 
    template &lt;class Event,class Fsm,class State&gt; 
    void operator()(Event const&amp;,Fsm&amp;,State&amp;) 
    {
        ... 
    } 
}; // same for Empty_Exit
struct Empty_tag {};
struct Empty : public msm::front::euml::func_state&lt;Empty_tag,Empty_Entry,Empty_Exit&gt;{};</pre><p>This also means that you can, like in the transition table, write entry /
                        exit actions made of more complicated action combinations. The previous
                        example can therefore <a class="link" href="examples/SimpleWithFunctors2.cpp" target="_top">be
                            rewritten</a>.</p><p>Usually, however, one will probably use the standard state definition as
                        it provides the same capabilities as this front-end state definition, unless
                        one needs some of the shipped predefined functors or is a fan of functional
                        programming.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="What do you actually do inside actions / guards (Part 2)?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1300"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="functor-front-end-actions"></a></strong></span>What do you actually do inside actions / guards (Part 2)?</h3></div></div></div><p>Using the basic front-end, we saw how to pass data to actions through the
                        event, that data common to all states could be stored in the state machine,
                        state relevant data could be stored in the state and access as template
                        parameter in the entry / exit actions. What was however missing was the
                        capability to access relevant state data in the transition action. This is
                        possible with this front-end. A transition's source and target state are
                        also given as arguments. If the current calculation's state was to be found
                        in the transition's source state (whatever it is), we could access
                        it:</p><pre class="programlisting">struct send_rocket 
{ 
    template &lt;class Fsm,class Evt,class SourceState,class TargetState&gt; 
    void operator()(Evt const&amp;, Fsm&amp; fsm, SourceState&amp; src,TargetState&amp; ) 
    {
        fire_rocket(evt.direction, src.current_calculation);
    } 
}; </pre><p>It was a little awkward to generate new events inside actions with the basic
                front-end. With the functor front-end it is much cleaner:</p><pre class="programlisting">struct send_rocket 
{ 
    template &lt;class Fsm,class Evt,class SourceState,class TargetState&gt; 
    void operator()(Evt const&amp; evt, Fsm&amp; fsm, SourceState&amp; src,TargetState&amp;) 
    {
        fire_rocket(evt.direction, src.current_calculation);
        fsm.process_event(rocket_launched());
    } 
}; </pre></div><div class="sect2" title="Defining a simple state machine"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1312"></a>Defining a simple state machine</h3></div></div></div><p>Like states, state machines can be defined using the previous front-end,
                        as the previous example showed, or with the functor front-end, which allows
                        you to define a state machine entry and exit functions as functors, as in
                            <a class="link" href="examples/SimpleWithFunctors2.cpp" target="_top">this
                        example</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Anonymous transitions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1320"></a>Anonymous transitions</h3></div></div></div><p>Anonymous (completion) transitions are transitions without a named event.
                        We saw how this front-end uses <code class="code">none</code> when no action or guard is
                        required. We can also use <code class="code">none</code> instead of an event to mark an
                        anonymous transition. For example, the following transition makes an
                        immediate transition from State1 to State2:</p><pre class="programlisting">Row &lt; State1 , none , State2 &gt;</pre><p>The following transition does the same but calling an action in the
                        process:</p><pre class="programlisting">Row &lt; State1 , none , State2 , State1ToState2, none &gt;</pre><p>The following diagram shows an example and its <a class="link" href="examples/AnonymousTutorialWithFunctors.cpp" target="_top">implementation</a>:</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/Anonymous.jpg" width="70%"></span></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Internal transitions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1346"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="functor-internal-transitions"></a></strong></span>Internal

                        front-end. As for the simple standard front-end, both methods of defining
                        internal transitions are supported:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>providing a <code class="code">Row</code> in the state machine's transition

                                    defines UML-conform internal transitions with higher

                                    really are <code class="code">Row</code> without a source or target state)
                                    .</p></li></ul></div><p>Like for the <span class="command"><strong><a class="command" href="ch03s02.html#internal-transitions-note">standard front-end internal transitions</a></strong></span>, internal transition
                        tables are added into the main state machine's table, thus allowing you to
                        distribute the transition table definition and reuse states.</p><p>There is an added bonus offered for submachines, which can have both the
                        standard transition_table and an internal_transition_table (which has higher
                        priority). This makes it easier if you decide to make a full submachine from
                        a state later. It is also slightly faster than the standard alternative,
                        adding orthogonal regions, because event dispatching will, if accepted by
                        the internal table, not continue to the subregions. This gives you a O(1)
                        dispatch instead of O(number of regions). While the example is with eUML,
                        the same is also possible with this front-end.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Kleene (any) event"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1392"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="any-event"></a></strong></span>Kleene (any) event</h3></div></div></div><p>Normally, MSM requires an event to fire a transition. But there are cases,
                        where any event, no matter which one would do:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>If you want to reduce the number of transitions: any event

                                    which caused their activation, or they might want to know only a
                                    property of it.</p></li></ul></div><p>MSM supports a boost::any as an acceptable event. This event will match
                        any event, meaning that if a transition with boost::any as event originates
                        from the current state, this transition would fire (provided no guards or
                        transition with a higher priority fires first). This event is named Kleene,
                        as reference top the Kleene star used in a regex.</p><p>For example, this transition on a state machine instance named fsm:</p><pre class="programlisting">Row &lt; State1, boost::any, State2&gt;</pre><p>will fire if State1 is active and an event is processed:</p><pre class="programlisting">fsm.process_event(whatever_event());</pre><p>At this point, you can use this <span class="italic">any</span>
                        event in transition actions to get back to the original event by calling for
                            example<span class="italic"> boost::any::type()</span>.</p><p>It is also possible to support your own Kleene events by specializing
                        boost::msm::is_kleene_event for a given event, for example:</p><pre class="programlisting">namespace boost { namespace msm{
    template&lt;&gt; 
    struct is_kleene_event&lt; my_event &gt;
    { 
      typedef boost::mpl::true_ type;
    };
}}</pre><p>The only requirement is that this event must have a copy constructor from
                        the event originally processed on the state machine.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s02.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Basic front-end&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;eUML (experimental)</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
