                        It is composed of a finite number of states and transitions.</p><p>
                        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/sm.gif"></span></p><p>A simple state has no sub states. It can have data, entry and exit
                        behaviors and deferred events. One can provide entry and exit behaviors
                        (also called actions) to states (or state machines), which are executed
                        whenever a state is entered or left, no matter how. A state can also have
                        internal transitions which cause no entry or exit behavior to be called. A
                        state can mark events as deferred. This means the event cannot be processed
                        if this state is active, but it must be retained. Next time a state not
                        deferring this event is active, the event will be processed, as if it had
                        just been fired. </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/state.gif"></span></p><p>A transition is the switching between active states, triggered by an
                        event. Actions and guard conditions can be attached to the transition. The
                        action executes when the transition fires, the guard is a Boolean operation
                        executed first and which can prevent the transition from firing by returning
                        false.</p><p>
                        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/transition.jpg"></span></p><p>An initial state marks the first active state of a state machine. It has
                        no real existence and neither has the transition originating from it.</p><p>

                        more regions. A composite state contains its own set of states and regions. </p><p>A submachine is a state machine inserted as a state in another state
                        machine. The same submachine can be inserted more than once. </p><p>Orthogonal regions are parts of a composite state or submachine, each
                        having its own set of mutually exclusive set of states and transitions. </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/regions.gif" width="60%"></span></p><p>UML also defines a number of pseudo states, which are considered important
                        concepts to model, but not enough to make them first-class citizens. The
                        terminate pseudo state terminates the execution of a state machine (MSM
                        handles this slightly differently. The state machine is not destroyed but no
                        further event processing occurs.). </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/terminate.gif"></span></p><p>An exit point pseudo state exits a composite state or a submachine and
                        forces termination of execution in all contained regions.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/exit.gif" width="60%"></span></p><p>An entry point pseudo state allows a kind of controlled entry inside a
                        composite. Precisely, it connects a transition outside the composite to a
                        transition inside the composite. An important point is that this mechanism
                        only allows a single region to be entered. In the above diagram, in region1,
                        the initial state would become active. </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/entry_point.gif"></span></p><p>There are also two more ways to enter a submachine (apart the obvious and
                        more common case of a transition terminating on the submachine as shown in
                        the region case). An explicit entry means that an inside state is the target
                        of a transition. Unlike with direct entry, no tentative encapsulation is
                        made, and only one transition is executed. An explicit exit is a transition
                        from an inner state to a state outside the submachine (not supported by
                        MSM). I would not recommend using explicit entry or exit. </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/explicit.gif"></span></p><p>The last entry possibility is using fork. A fork is an explicit entry into
                        one or more regions. Other regions are again activated using their initial
                        state. </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/fork.gif" width="70%"></span></p></div><div class="sect2" title="History"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e194"></a>
                        <span class="command"><strong><a name="uml-history"></a></strong></span>History </h3></div></div></div><p>UML defines two kinds of history, shallow history and deep history.
                        Shallow history is a pseudo state representing the most recent substate of a
                        submachine. A submachine can have at most one shallow history. A transition
                        with a history pseudo state as target is equivalent to a transition with the
                        most recent substate as target. And very importantly, only one transition
                        may originate from the history. Deep history is a shallow history
                        recursively reactivating the substates of the most recent substate. It is
                        represented like the shallow history with a star (H* inside a
                        circle).</p><p>
                        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/history.gif" width="60%"></span></p><p>History is not a completely satisfying concept. First of all, there can be
                        just one history pseudo state and only one transition may originate from it.
                        So they do not mix well with orthogonal regions as only one region can be
                        &#8220;remembered&#8221;. Deep history is even worse and looks like a last-minute
                        addition. History has to be activated by a transition and only one
                        transition originates from it, so how to model the transition originating
                        from the deep history pseudo state and pointing to the most recent substate
                        of the substate? As a bonus, it is also inflexible and does not accept new
                        types of histories. Let's face it, history sounds great and is useful in
                        theory, but the UML version is not quite making the cut. And therefore, MSM
                        provides a different version of this useful concept. </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Completion transitions / anonymous transitions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e208"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="uml-anonymous"></a></strong></span>Completion transitions / anonymous
                        transitions</h3></div></div></div><p>Completion events (or transitions), also called anonymous transitions, are
                        defined as transitions having no defined event triggering them. This means
                        that such transitions will immediately fire when a state being the source of
                        an anonymous transition becomes active, provided that a guard allows it.
                        They are useful in modeling algorithms as an activity diagram would normally
                        do. In the real-time world, they have the advantage of making it easier to
                        estimate how long a periodically executed action will last. For example,
                        consider the following diagram. </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/completion.gif"></span></p><p>The designer now knows at any time that he will need a maximum of 4
                        transitions. Being able to estimate how long a transition takes, he can
                        estimate how much of a time frame he will need to require (real-time tasks
                        are often executed at regular intervals). If he can also estimate the
                        duration of actions, he can even use graph algorithms to better estimate his
                        timing requirements. </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Internal transitions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e220"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="UML-internal-transition"></a></strong></span> Internal transitions </h3></div></div></div><p>Internal transitions are transitions executing in the scope of the active

                                    another state.</p></li></ul></div><p>The first one is simple; one only needs to define two or more
                        rows in the transition table, with the same source and trigger, with a
                        different guard condition. Beware, however, that the UML standard wants
                        these conditions to be not overlapping. If they do, the standard says
                        nothing except that this is incorrect, so the implementer is free to
                        implement it the way he sees fit. In the case of MSM, the transition
                        appearing last in the transition table gets selected first, if it returns
                        false (meaning disabled), the library tries with the previous one, and so
                        on.</p><p>
                        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/conflict1.gif"></span></p><p>In the second case, UML defines that the most inner transition gets
                        selected first, which makes sense, otherwise no exit point pseudo state
                        would be possible (the inner transition brings us to the exit point, from
                        where the containing state machine can take over). </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/conflict2.gif" width="60%"></span></p><p>MSM handles both cases itself, so the designer needs only concentrate on
                        its state machine and the UML subtleties (not overlapping conditions), not
                        on implementing this behavior himself. </p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch02s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;UML Short Guide&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Added concepts</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
