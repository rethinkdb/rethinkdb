These are not part of the library itself, but rather
techiques on how to use the library to address specific situations.

<h2><a name="functionobject"></a>Serializing a Function Object</h2>
An example on how to serialize a function object.  I believe this
could be done by serializing pointer to the object in question.  Since
the Serialization library resurrects pointer of the correct type
this should be easily implementable.
<p>
If a group of function objects were all derived from the
same polymorphic base class - perhaps via multiple inheritance,
the the function object effectively becomes a "variable" which
encapsulates code.
<p>
This case study would show how to do this.

<h2><a name="archiveadaptor"></a>Archive Adaptors</h2>

Often users want to add their own special functionality to an
existing archive.  Examples of this are performance enhancements
for specific types, Adjustment of output syntax for xml archives,
and logging/debug output as archives are written and/or read.
If this functionalty is implemented as an "adaptor" template
which takes the base class as a template argument, such functionality
appended to any archive for which that funtionality makes sense.
For example, an adaptor for generating an xml schema could be
appended to both wide narrow character versions of xml archives.
<p>
This case study would show how to make a useful archive adaptor.

<h2><a name="archivehelper"></a>Archive Helpers</h2>
Some types are not serializable as they stand.  That is - they
do not fullfill the requirements of the "Serializable Concept".
The iconic example of this is boost::shared_ptr.  Sometimes
these types could be made serializable by adding code inside
the library.  Of course, doing that would create a lifetime
of unpaid employment for the library author. Rather than
adding a bunch of special code to the library itself, this
code can packaged as a "helper" or "mix-in" class.  Then
a new archive is derived from both the "base" archive class
AND the "helper" class.  This is how boost::shared_ptr
has been implemented.
<p>
It would also be possible to make a "generic runtime helper"
which would effectively extend the API of the library.  Previously
the library included such a helper class.  It was removed
in favor of the current implementation.  But this functionality
should be added back in with another adaptor which would
become part of the library.
