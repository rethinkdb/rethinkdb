[section Installing Proto]
[/=======================]

[/====================]
[heading Getting Proto]
[/====================]

You can get Proto
by downloading Boost (Proto is in version 1.37 and later),
or by accessing Boost's SVN repository on SourceForge.net. Just go to
[@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/BoostSubversion]
and follow the instructions there for anonymous SVN access.

[/==========================]
[heading Building with Proto]
[/==========================]

Proto is a header-only template library, which means you don't need to alter
your build scripts or link to any separate lib file to use it. All you need
to do is `#include <boost/proto/proto.hpp>`. Or, you might decide to just
include the core of Proto (`#include <boost/proto/core.hpp>`) and whichever
contexts and transforms you happen to use.

[/===================]
[heading Requirements]
[/===================]

Proto depends on Boost. You must use either Boost version 1.34.1 or higher,
or the version in SVN trunk.

[/==========================]
[heading Supported Compilers]
[/==========================]

Currently, Boost.Proto is known to work on the following compilers:

* Visual C++ 8 and higher
* GNU C++ 3.4 and higher
* Intel on Linux 8.1 and higher
* Intel on Windows 9.1 and higher
