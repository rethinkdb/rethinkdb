[section Binding member functions]

[import ../examples/bind_member_functions.cpp]

Binding member functions to a function objects suitable for odeint system function is not easy, at least in C++03. The usual way of using __boost_bind does not work because of the forwarding problem. odeint provides two `do_step` method which only differ in the const specifiers of the arguments and __boost_bind binders only provide the specializations up to two argument which is not enough for odeint.

But one can easily implement the according binders themself:

[ode_wrapper]

One can use this binder as follows

[bind_member_function]

[section Binding member functions in C++11]

[import ../examples/bind_member_functions_cpp11.cpp]
In C++11 one can use `std::bind` and one does not need to implement the bind themself:

[bind_member_function_cpp11]
