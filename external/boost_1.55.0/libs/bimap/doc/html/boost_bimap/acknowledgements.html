      This library was developed in the context of the Google SoC 2006. I first want
      to thank my mentor, Joaquin, for his friendship during this project. Not only
      did he help me go through the process of creating this library, but he also
      did his best so we could have a great time doing it. Also, Boost.Bimap would
      not exist had Boost.MultiIndex, Joaquin's masterpiece, not existed. Thanks
      a lot!

      I want to thank Google for this amazing <span class="emphasis"><em>boost</em></span> to the open-source
      community and to Boost mentors for trusting in my proposal in the first place.
      Next on the list are my colleagues from SoC that helped me not get bored during
      the long hours of coding.
    </p>
<p>
      Special acknowledgements to the developers of the Boost libraries that Boost.Bimap
      has abused. See the dependencies section for a complete list.
    </p>
<p>
      I want to thank the open-source developers who wrote the tools I used during
      this project. The list of names is infinitely long, so I give a general huge
      thanks here.
    </p>
<p>
      Thanks to Paul Giaccone for proof-reading this documentation. (He has not finished
      yet -- the remaining typos and spelling errors are mine and will be corrected
      as soon as possible.)
    </p>
<p>
      Finally, thanks to my family, who had to see me at home all day during the
      SoC. Special thanks to my brother Agustin, future famous novelist (at the present
      time he is 19 years old), who patiently read every word of these docs and while
      correcting them, barked at me for my bad written English. I have learned a
      lot from his sermons. I want to thank my dog, Mafalda, too for barking all
      day from my window and for being such a good company.
    </p>
<p>
      Thanks to Alisdair Meredith, Fernando Cacciola, Jeff Garland, John Maddock,
      Thorsten Ottosen, Tony and Giovanni Piero Deretta for participating in the
      formal review and give me useful advices to improve this library. And thanks
      a lot to Ion Gazta&#241;aga for managing the review.
    </p>
