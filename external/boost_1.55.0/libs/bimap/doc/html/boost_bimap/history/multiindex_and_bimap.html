        This is the conversation thread that began during Boost.PropertyTree formal
        review process. The review was very interesting and very deep topics were
        addressed. It is quite interesting and it is now part of this library history.
        Enjoy!

        <span class="bold"><strong>Specialized containers with Boost.MultiIndex</strong></span>
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>Introduction</strong></span>
      </p>
<p>
        Boost.MultiIndex allows the construction of complex data structures involving
        two or more indexing mechanisms on the same set of elements. Out of the unlimited
        range of possible data structures specifiable within Boost.MultiIndex, some
        particular configurations arise recurrently:
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>a.</strong></span> A bidirectional map or bimap is a container
        of elements of type pair&lt;T,Q&gt; where fast look up is provided both for
        the T and the Q field, in contrast with a regular STL map which only allows
        for fast look up on T.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>b.</strong></span> An MRU (most recently used) list keeps
        the n last referenced elements: when a new item is inserted and the list
        has reached its maximum length, the oldest element is erased, whereas if
        an insertion is tried of a preexistence element, this gets promoted to the
        first position. MRU lists can be used to implement dynamic caches and the
        kind of behavior exhibited by programs featuring a "Recent files"
        menu command, for instance.
      </p>
<p>
        Although Boost.MultiIndex provides the mechanisms to build these common structures,
        the resulting interface can be cumbersome and too general in comparison with
        specialized containers focusing on such particular structures.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>Goal</strong></span>
      </p>
<p>
        To write a library of specialized containers like the ones described above,
        using Boost.MultiIndex as the implementation core. Besides bimap and MRU
        list, the student can also propose other specialized containers of interest
        in the community. It is expected that the library meets the standards of
        quality required by Boost for an eventual inclusion in this project, which
        implies a strong emphasis on interface design, documentation and unit testing;
        the mentor will be guiding the student through the complete cycle from specification
        and requirements gathering to documentation and actual coding. The final
        result of the project must then contain:
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>a.</strong></span> Source code following <a href="http://boost.org/more/lib_guide.htm#Guidelines" target="_top">Boost
        programming guidelines</a>.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>b.</strong></span> User documentation. Requirements on the
        format are loose, though the <a href="http://www.boost.org/tools/quickbook/" target="_top">QuickBook</a>
        format is gaining acceptance within Boost.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>c.</strong></span> Complete set of unit tests powered by
        <a href="http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/" target="_top">Boost Build System V2</a>.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>Requirements</strong></span>
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>a.</strong></span> Intermediate-to-high level in C++, with
        emphasis in generic programming (templates).
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>b.</strong></span> Knowledge of the STL framework and design
        principles. Of course, knowledge of Boost in general and Boost.MultiIndex
        in particular is a big plus.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>c.</strong></span> Acquaintance with at least two different
        C++ programming environments.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>d.</strong></span> Some fluency in the English language;
        subsequent reviews of the documentation can help smooth rough edges here,
        though.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>e.</strong></span> A mathematical inclination and previous
        exposure to a formal Algorithms course would help very much.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>f.</strong></span> A craving for extreme quality work.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>Benefits for the student</strong></span>
      </p>
<p>
        The student taking on this project will have the opportunity to learn the
        complete process of software production inside a highly regarded C++ open
        source institution, and even see her work included in Boost eventually. The
        completion of the project involves non-trivial problems in C++ interface
        design and so-called modern C++ programming, high quality user documentation
        and unit testing. The student will also learn, perhaps to her surprise, that
        most of the time will be spent gathering and trying ideas and, in general,
        thinking, rather than writing actual code.
