[section Acknowledgements]

This library was developed in the context of the Google SoC 2006. I
first want to thank my mentor, Joaquin, for his friendship during this
project. Not only did he help me go through the process of creating this
library, but he also did his best so we could have a great time doing
it. Also, Boost.Bimap would not exist had Boost.MultiIndex, Joaquin's
masterpiece, not existed. Thanks a lot!

__GOOGLE_SOC_2006__

I want to thank Google for this amazing ['boost] to the open-source
community and to Boost mentors for trusting in my proposal in the first
place. Next on the list are my colleagues from SoC that helped me not
get bored during the long hours of coding.

Special acknowledgements to the developers of the Boost libraries that
Boost.Bimap has abused. See the dependencies section for a complete list.

I want to thank the open-source developers who wrote the tools I used
during this project. The list of names is infinitely long, so I
give a general huge thanks here.

Thanks to Paul Giaccone for proof-reading this documentation. (He has
not finished yet -- the remaining typos and spelling errors are mine and
will be corrected as soon as possible.)

Finally, thanks to my family, who had to see me at home all day during
the SoC. Special thanks to my brother Agustin, future famous novelist
(at the present time he is 19 years old), who patiently read every word
of these docs and while correcting them, barked at me for my bad written
English. I have learned a lot from his sermons. I want to thank my dog,
Mafalda, too for barking all day from my window and for being such a
good company.

Thanks to Alisdair Meredith, Fernando Cacciola, Jeff Garland, John Maddock,
Thorsten Ottosen, Tony and Giovanni Piero Deretta for participating in
the formal review and give me useful advices to improve this library.
And thanks a lot to Ion Gazta√±aga for managing the review.
