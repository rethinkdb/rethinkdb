		or were instrumental in the development of the library by Vesa Karnoven and myself.

	<h4>Vesa Karvonen</h4>

		The original idea of passing two extra parameters to REPEAT, which makes it possible to create preprocessor code on top of it,
		was due to Aleksey Gurtovoy.&nbsp;
		The invokeable IDENTITY macro was invented by him.&nbsp;
		He also suggested the name for the library.&nbsp;
		Many thanks to Aleksey for his insights!
