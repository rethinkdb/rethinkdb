The [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution triangular distribution]
is a [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_distribution continuous]
[@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution probability distribution]
with a lower limit a,
[@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_%28statistics%29 mode c],
and upper limit b.

The triangular distribution is often used where the distribution is only vaguely known,
but, like the [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_%28continuous%29 uniform distribution],
upper and limits are 'known', but a 'best guess', the mode or center point, is also added.
It has been recommended as a
[@http://www.worldscibooks.com/mathematics/etextbook/5720/5720_chap1.pdf proxy for the beta distribution.]
The distribution is used in business decision making and project planning.

The [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution triangular distribution]
is a distribution with the 
[@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function probability density function]:

f(x) =

* 2(x-a)/(b-a) (c-a) for a <= x <= c

* 2(b-x)/(b-a)(b-c) for c < x <= b
        
Parameter a (lower) can be any finite value.
Parameter b (upper) can be any finite value > a (lower).
Parameter c (mode) a <= c <= b.  This is the most probable value.

The [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variate random variate] x must also be finite, and is supported lower <= x <= upper.

The triangular distribution may be appropriate when an assumption of a normal distribution
is unjustified because uncertainty is caused by rounding and quantization from analog to digital conversion.
Upper and lower limits are known, and the most probable value lies midway.

The distribution simplifies when the 'best guess' is either the lower or upper limit - a 90 degree angle triangle.
The default chosen is the 001 triangular distribution which expresses an estimate that the lowest value is the most likely;
for example, you believe that the next-day quoted delivery date is most likely
(knowing that a quicker delivery is impossible - the postman only comes once a day),
and that longer delays are decreasingly likely,
and delivery is assumed to never take more than your upper limit.

The following graph illustrates how the
[@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function probability density function PDF]
varies with the various parameters:

[h4 Member Functions]

   triangular_distribution(RealType lower = 0, RealType mode = 0 RealType upper = 1);
   
Constructs a [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/triangular_distribution triangular distribution]
with lower  /lower/ (a) and upper /upper/ (b).

Requires that the /lower/, /mode/ and /upper/ parameters are all finite, 
otherwise calls __domain_error.

   RealType lower()const;
   
Returns the /lower/ parameter of this distribution (default -1).
   
   RealType mode()const;
   
Returns the /mode/ parameter of this distribution (default 0).

   RealType upper()const;
      
Returns the /upper/ parameter of this distribution (default+1).

[h4 Non-member Accessors]

All the [link math_toolkit.dist_ref.nmp usual non-member accessor functions] that are generic to all
distributions are supported: __usual_accessors.

The domain of the random variable is \lower\ to \upper\,
and the supported range is lower <= x <= upper.

[h4 Accuracy]

The triangular distribution is implemented with simple arithmetic operators and so should have errors within an epsilon or two,
except quantiles with arguments nearing the extremes of zero and unity. 

[h4 Implementation]

In the following table, a is the /lower/ parameter of the distribution, 
c is the /mode/ parameter,
b is the /upper/ parameter,
/x/ is the random variate, /p/ is the probability and /q = 1-p/.

[table
[[Function][Implementation Notes]]
[[pdf][Using the relation: pdf = 0 for x < mode, 2(x-a)\/(b-a)(c-a) else 2*(b-x)\/((b-a)(b-c))]]
[[cdf][Using the relation: cdf = 0 for x < mode (x-a)[super 2]\/((b-a)(c-a)) else 1 - (b-x)[super 2]\/((b-a)(b-c))]]

x = c                     ; for p == p0

x = b - sqrt((b-a)(b-c)q) ; for p > p0
