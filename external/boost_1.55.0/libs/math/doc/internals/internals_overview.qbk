[section:internals_overview Overview]

This section contains internal utilities used by the library's implementation
along with tools used in development and testing.  These tools have
only minimal documentation, and crucially ['do not have stable interfaces].

There is no doubt that these components can be improved, but they are also
largely incidental to the main purpose of this library.

These tools are designed to "just get the job done", and receive minimal
documentation here, in the hopes that they will help stimulate further
submissions to this library.
