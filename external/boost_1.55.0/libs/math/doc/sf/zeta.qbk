[section:zeta Riemann Zeta Function]

[h4 Synopsis]

``
#include <boost/math/special_functions/zeta.hpp>
``

   namespace boost{ namespace math{
   
   template <class T>
   ``__sf_result`` zeta(T z);
   
   template <class T, class ``__Policy``>
   ``__sf_result`` zeta(T z, const ``__Policy``&);
   
   }} // namespaces
   
The return type of these functions is computed using the __arg_pomotion_rules:
the return type is `double` if T is an integer type, and T otherwise.

[h4 Description]

   template <class T>
   ``__sf_result`` zeta(T z);
   
   template <class T, class ``__Policy``>
   ``__sf_result`` zeta(T z, const ``__Policy``&);
   
Returns the [@http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RiemannZetaFunction.html zeta function]
of z:

[h4 Accuracy]

The following table shows the peak errors (in units of epsilon) 
found on various platforms with various floating point types, 
along with comparisons to the __gsl and __cephes libraries.
Unless otherwise specified any floating point type that is narrower
than the one shown will have __zero_error.

[h4 Testing]

The tests for these functions come in two parts:
basic sanity checks use spot values calculated using
[@http://functions.wolfram.com/webMathematica/FunctionEvaluation.jsp?name=Zeta Mathworld's online evaluator],
while accuracy checks use high-precision test values calculated at 1000-bit precision with
[@http://shoup.net/ntl/doc/RR.txt NTL::RR] and this implementation. 
Note that the generic and type-specific
versions of these functions use differing implementations internally, so this
gives us reasonably independent test data.  Using our test data to test other
"known good" implementations also provides an additional sanity check. 

[h4 Implementation]

All versions of these functions first use the usual reflection formulas
to make their arguments positive:

[equation zeta3]

The generic versions of these functions are implemented using the series:

[equation zeta6]

When the significand (mantissa) size is recognised
(currently for 53, 64 and 113-bit reals, plus single-precision 24-bit handled via promotion to double)
then a series of rational approximations [jm_rationals] are used.

For 0 < z < 1 the approximating form is:

[equation zeta4]

For a rational approximation R(1-z) and a constant C.

For 1 < z < 4 the approximating form is:

[equation zeta5]

For a rational approximation R(n-z) and a constant C and integer n.

For z > 4 the approximating form is:

[zeta](z) = 1 + e[super R(z - n)]

For a rational approximation R(z-n) and integer n, note that the accuracy 
required for R(z-n) is not full machine precision, but an absolute error
of: [epsilon]/R(0).  This saves us quite a few digits when dealing with large 
z, especially when [epsilon] is small.
