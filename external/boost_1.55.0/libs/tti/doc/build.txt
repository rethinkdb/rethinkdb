The library comes with full documentation with an index, 
in both HTML and PDF format. The HTML documentation is at 
tti\libs\tti\doc\html\index.html and the PDF documentation 
is at tti\libs\tti\doc\TypeTraitsIntrospection.pdf.

You can use the jamfile in the doc directory to regenerate 
the documentation for this library. 

Add '--enable-index' to the command line to have an index 
with the documentation. Add 'pdf' on the command line to
regenerate the PDF documentation.

You can use the jamfile in the test directory to 
run the tests for this library.

When running the tests you can use either of 
three main targets if you like. Executing the jamfile without a 
target, or specifying the target 'tti', will run tests for both 
basic TTI and for the variadic macro portion of TTI. You can run 
tests for only the basic TTI, which is the vast majority of TTI 
functionality, by specifying only the 'ttinovm' target when 
executing the jamfile. If you just want to run the tests for the 
variadic macro portion of TTI, specify the target as 'ttivm'.

You need only execute 'bjam' in the jamfile directories 
to regenerate the docs or run the test.

If you want to contact me directly, my name is 
Edward Diener and you can reach me at

consultant with my own company, I live in Atlanta, Georgia,
and I am always looking for exciting projects on which to 
work for a living.

You can also of course use the Boost newsgroups 
to ask questions and make comments or suggestions 
about the library.
