[section:tti_acknowledgments Acknowledgments]

The TTI library came out of my effort to take the 
`type_traits_ext` part of the unfinished Concept Traits
Library and expand it. So my first thanks go to 
Terje Slettebo and Tobias Schwinger, the authors of 
the CTL. I have taken, and hopefully improved upon, 
the ideas and implementation in that library, and added
some new functionality.

I would also like to thank Joel Falcou for 
his help and his introspection work. 

Two of the introspection templates are taken from the MPL and 
lifted into my library under a different name for the sake 
of completeness, so I would like to thank Aleksey Gurtovoy and
David Abrahams for that library, and Daniel Walker for work on 
those MPL introspection macros.

Finally thanks to Anthony Williams for supplying a workaround 
for a Visual C++ bug which is needed for introspecting member 
data where the type of the member data is a compound type.
