[section:tti_terminology Terminology]

The term "enclosing type" refers to the type which is being introspected. 
This type is always a class, struct, or union.

The term "inner xxx", where xxx is some element of the enclosing type, 
refers to either a type, template, function, or data within the enclosing 
type. The term "inner element" also refers to any one of these entities in general.

I use the term "nested type" to refer to a type within another type.
I use the term "member function" or "member data" to refer to non-static 
functions or data that are part of the enclosing type.
I use the term "static member function" or "static member data" to refer to static 
functions or data that are part of the enclosing type.
I use the term "nested class template" to refer to a class template 
nested within the enclosing type.

Other terminology may be just as valid for the notion of C++ language 
elements within a type, but I have chosen these terms to be consistent.

The term "generated metafunction(s)" refers to macro metafunctions
which are generated by macros.
