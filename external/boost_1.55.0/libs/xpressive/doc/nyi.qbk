[section Appendix 2: Not Yet Implemented]

The following features are planned for xpressive 2.X:

* `syntax_option_type::collate`
* Collation sequences such as [^'''[.a.]''']
* Equivalence classes like [^'''[=a=]''']
* Control of nested results generation with `syntax_option_type::nosubs`,
  and a `nosubs()` modifier for static xpressive.

Here are some wish-list features. You or your company should
consider hiring me to implement them!

* Optimized DFA back-end for simple, fast regexing.
* Different regex compiler front ends for basic, extended, awk, grep
  and egrep regex syntax.
* Fine-grained control over the dynamic regex syntax
* Optional integration with ICU for full Unicode support.
* Improved localization support, possibly as a custom facet for `std::locale`.
