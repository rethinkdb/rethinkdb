<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Error conditions originating from the operating system or other low-level 
application program interfaces (API's) are typically reported via an integer 
representing an error code. When these low-level API calls are wrapped in 
portable code, such as in a portable library, some users want to deal with the 
error codes in portable ways. Other users need to get at the system specific 
error codes, so they can deal with system specific needs. The Boost System 
library provides simple, light-weight <a href="reference.html#Class-error_code">
error_code</a> objects that encapsulate system-specific error code values, yet 
also provide access to more abstract and portable error conditions via
<a href="reference.html#Class-error_condition">error_condition</a> objects. 
Because error_code objects can represent errors from sources other than the 
operating system, including user-defined sources, each error_code and 
error_condition has an associated <a href="reference.html#Class-error_category">
error_category</a>.</p>

<p>An exception class,&nbsp; <a href="reference.html#Class-system_error">
system_error</a>, is provided. Derived from std::runtime_error, it captures the 
underlying error_code for the problem causing the exception so that this 
important information is not lost.</p>
<p>While exceptions are the preferred C++ default error code reporting 
mechanism, users of libraries dependent on low-level API's&nbsp;often need overloads 
reporting error conditions via error code arguments and/or return values rather 
than via throwing exceptions. Otherwise, when errors are not exceptional 
occurrences and must be dealt with as they arise, programs become littered with 
try/catch blocks, unreadable, and very inefficient. The Boost System library 
supports both error reporting by exception and by error code.</p>
<p>In addition to portable errors codes and conditions supported by the <code>
error_code.hpp</code> header, system-specific headers support the Cygwin, Linux, 
and Windows platforms. These headers are effectively no-ops if included for 
platforms other than their intended target.</p>

<h2><a name="Design_Rationale">Design Rationale</a></h2>
<p>Class <code>error_code</code>&nbsp; and <code>error_condition</code> are designed as a value types so 
they can be copied 
without slicing and do not requiring heap allocation, but still have polymorphic 
behavior based on the error category. This is achieved by abstract base class
<code>error_category</code> supplying the polymorphic behavior, and <code>
error_code</code> and <code>error_condition</code> containing a pointer to an object of a type derived from <code>
error_category</code>.</p>
<p>Many of the detailed design decisions were driven by the requirements that 
users to be able to add additional error categories, and that it be no more 
difficult to write portable code than system-specific code.</p>
<p>The <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code> overload for <code>error_code</code> eliminates a 
misleading conversion to bool in code like <code>cout &lt;&lt; ec</code>, where <code>
ec</code> is of type <code>error_code</code>. It is also useful in its own 
right.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n1975.html">
N1975</a>, Filesystem Library Proposal for TR2, accepted for Library Technical 
Report 2 (TR2) at the Berlin meeting, included additional components to 
supplement the Standard Library's Diagnostics clause. Since then, these error 
reporting components have received wider public scrutiny and enhancements have 
been made to the design. The enhanced version has been used by N2054, Networking 
Library Proposal for TR2, demonstrating that these error reporting components 
are useful beyond the original Filesystem Library.</p>
<p>The original proposal viewed error categories as a binary choice between
<code>errno</code> (i.e. POSIX-style) and the native operating system's error 
codes. The proposed components now allow as many additional error categories as 
are needed by either implementations or by users. The need to support additional 
error categories, for example, occurs in some networking library implementations 
because they are built on top of the POSIX <code>getaddrinfo</code> API that 
uses error codes not based on <code>errno</code>.</p>

<p>Christopher Kohlhoff and Peter Dimov made important contributions to the 
design. Comments and suggestions were also received from Pavel Vozenilek, 
Gennaro Prota, Dave Abrahams, Jeff Garland, Iain Hanson, Oliver Kowalke, and 
Oleg Abrosimov. Christopher Kohlhoff suggested several improvements to the N2066 
paper. Johan Nilsson's comments led to several of the refinements in N2066 .</p>
