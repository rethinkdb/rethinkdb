[section:history Revision History]

[heading Asio 1.10.1 / Boost 1.55]

* Implemented a limited port to Windows Runtime. This support requires that the
  language extensions be enabled. Due to the restricted facilities exposed by
  the Windows Runtime API, the port also comes with the following caveats:
  * The core facilities such as the `io_service`, `strand`, buffers, composed
    operations, timers, etc., should all work as normal.
  * For sockets, only client-side TCP is supported.
  * Explicit binding of a client-side TCP socket is not supported.
  * The `cancel()` function is not supported for sockets. Asynchronous
    operations may only be cancelled by closing the socket.
  * Operations that use `null_buffers` are not supported.
  * Only `tcp::no_delay` and `socket_base::keep_alive` options are supported.
  * Resolvers do not support service names, only numbers. I.e. you must
    use "80" rather than "http".
  * Most resolver query flags have no effect.
* Fixed a regression (introduced in Boost 1.54) where, on some platforms, errors
  from `async_connect` were not correctly propagated through to the completion
  handler ([ticket 8795]).
* Fixed a Windows-specific regression (introduced in Boost 1.54) that occurs
  when multiple threads are running an `io_service`. When the bug occurs, the
  result of an asynchronous operation (error and bytes tranferred) is
  incorrectly discarded and zero values used instead. For TCP sockets this
  results in spurious end-of-file notifications ([ticket 8933]).
* Fixed a bug in handler tracking, where it was not correctly printing out some
  handler IDs ([ticket 8808]).
* Fixed the comparison used to test for successful synchronous accept
  operations so that it works correctly with unsigned socket descriptors
  ([ticket 8752]).
* Ensured the signal number is correctly passed to the completion handler when
  starting an `async_wait` on a signal that is already raised ([ticket 8738]).
* Suppressed a g++ 4.8+ warning about unused typedefs ([ticket 8980]).
* Enabled the move optimisation for handlers that use the default invocation
  hook ([ticket 8624]).
* Clarified that programs must not issue overlapping `async_write_at`
  operations ([ticket 8669]).
* Changed the Windows `HANDLE` backend to treat `ERROR_MORE_DATA` as a
  non-fatal error when returned by `GetOverlappedResult` for a synchronous
  read ([ticket 8722]).
* Visual C++ language extensions use `generic` as a keyword. Added a
  workaround that renames the namespace to `cpp_generic` when those language
  extensions are in effect.
* Fixed some asynchronous operations that missed out on getting `async_result`
  support in Boost 1.54. In particular, the buffered stream templates have been
  updated so that they adhere to current handler patterns ([ticket 9000],
  [ticket 9001]).
* Enabled move support for Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 ([ticket 8959]).
* Added `use_future` support for Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.
* Removed a use of `std::min` in the Windows IOCP backend to avoid a
  dependency on the `<algorithm>` header ([ticket 8758]).
* Eliminated some unnecessary handler copies.
* Fixed support for older versions of OpenSSL that do not provide the
  `SSL_CTX_clear_options` function ([ticket 9273]).
* Fixed various minor and cosmetic issues in code and documentation
  (including [ticket 8347], [ticket 8950], [ticket 8953], [ticket 8965],
  [ticket 8997], [ticket 9230]).

[heading Asio 1.10.0 / Boost 1.54]

* Added new traits classes, `handler_type` and `async_result`, that allow the
  customisation of the return type of an initiating function.
* Added the `asio::spawn()` function, a high-level wrapper for running
  stackful coroutines, based on the Boost.Coroutine library. The `spawn()`
  function enables programs to implement asynchronous logic in a synchronous
  manner. For example: `size_t n = my_socket.async_read_some(my_buffer, yield);`.
  For further information, see [link boost_asio.overview.core.spawn Stackful
  Coroutines].
* Added the `asio::use_future` special value, which provides first-class
  support for returning a C++11 `std::future` from an asynchronous
  operation's initiating function. For example:
  `future<size_t> = my_socket.async_read_some(my_buffer, asio::use_future);`.
  For further information, see [link boost_asio.overview.cpp2011.futures C++
  2011 Support - Futures].
* Promoted the stackless coroutine class and macros to be part of Asio's
  documented interface, rather than part of the HTTP server 4 example.
  For further information, see [link boost_asio.overview.core.coroutine
  Stackless Coroutines].
* Added a new handler hook called `asio_handler_is_continuation`.
  Asynchronous operations may represent a continuation of the asynchronous
  control flow associated with the current executing handler. The
  `asio_handler_is_continuation` hook can be customised to return `true` if
  this is the case, and Asio's implementation can use this knowledge to
  optimise scheduling of the new handler. To cover common cases, Asio
  customises the hook for strands, `spawn()` and composed asynchronous
  operations.
* Added four new generic protocol classes, `generic::datagram_protocol`,
  `generic::raw_protocol`, `generic::seq_packet_protocol` and
  `generic::stream_protocol`, which implement the `Protocol` type
  requirements, but allow the user to specify the address family (e.g.
  `AF_INET`) and protocol type (e.g. `IPPROTO_TCP`) at runtime.
  For further information, see [link
  boost_asio.overview.networking.other_protocols Support for Other Protocols].
* Added C++11 move constructors that allow the conversion of a socket (or
  acceptor) into a more generic type. For example, an `ip::tcp::socket` can
  be converted into a `generic::stream_protocol::socket` via move
  construction.
  For further information, see [link
  boost_asio.overview.networking.other_protocols Support for Other Protocols].
* Extended the `basic_socket_acceptor<>`'s `accept()` and `async_accept()`
  functions to allow a new connection to be accepted directly into a socket
  of a more generic type. For example, an `ip::tcp::acceptor` can be used to
  accept into a `generic::stream_protocol::socket` object.
  For further information, see [link
  boost_asio.overview.networking.other_protocols Support for Other Protocols].
* Moved existing examples into a C++03-specific directory, and added a new
  directory for C++11-specific examples. A limited subset of the C++03
  examples have been converted to their C++11 equivalents.
* Various SSL enhancements. Thanks go to Nick Jones, on whose work these changes
  are based.
  * Added support for SSL handshakes with re-use of data already read from
    the wire. New overloads of the `ssl::stream<>` class's `handshake()` and
    `async_handshake()` functions have been added. These accept a
    `ConstBufferSequence` to be used as initial input to the ssl engine for
    the handshake procedure.
  * Added support for creation of TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 `ssl::context` objects.
  * Added a `set_verify_depth()` function to the `ssl::context` and
    `ssl::stream<>` classes.
  * Added the ability to load SSL certificate and key data from memory
    buffers. New functions, `add_certificate_authority()`,
    `use_certificate()`, `use_certificate_chain()`, `use_private_key()`,
    `use_rsa_private_key()` and `use_tmp_dh()`, have been added to the
    `ssl::context` class.
  * Changed `ssl::context` to automatically disable SSL compression by
    default. To enable, use the new `ssl::context::clear_options()` function,
    as in `my_context.clear_options(ssl::context::no_compression)`.
* Fixed a potential deadlock in `signal_set` implementation.
* Fixed an error in acceptor example in documentation [ticket 8421].
* Fixed copy-paste errors in waitable timer documentation [ticket 8602].
* Added assertions to satisfy some code analysis tools [ticket 7739].
* Fixed a malformed `#warning` directive [ticket 7939].
* Fixed a potential data race in the Linux `epoll` implementation.
* Fixed a Windows-specific bug, where certain operations might generate an
  `error_code` with an invalid (i.e. `NULL`) `error_category` [ticket 8613].
* Fixed `basic_waitable_timer`'s underlying implementation so that it can
  handle any `time_point` value without overflowing the intermediate duration
  objects.
* Fixed a problem with lost thread wakeups that can occur when making
  concurrent calls to `run()` and `poll()` on the same `io_service` object
  [ticket 8354].
* Fixed implementation of asynchronous connect operation so that it can cope
  with spurious readiness notifications from the reactor [ticket 7961].
* Fixed a memory leak in the `ssl::rfc2818_verification` class.
* Added a mechanism for disabling automatic Winsock initialisation [ticket
  3605]. See the header file [^boost/asio/detail/winsock_init.hpp] for details.

[heading Asio 1.8.3 / Boost 1.53]

* Fixed some 64-to-32-bit conversion warnings ([ticket 7459]).
* Fixed some small errors in documentation and comments ([ticket 7761]).
* Fixed an error in the example embedded in `basic_socket::get_option`'s
  documentation ([ticket 7562]).
* Changed to use `long` rather than `int` for SSL_CTX options, to match OpenSSL
  ([ticket 7209]).
* Changed to use `_snwprintf` to address a compile error due to the changed
  `swprintf` signature in recent versions of MinGW ([ticket 7373]).
* Fixed a deadlock that can occur on Windows when shutting down a pool of
  `io_service` threads due to running out of work ([ticket 7552]).
* Enabled the `noexcept` qualifier for error categories ([ticket 7797]).
* Changed UNIX domain socket example to treat errors from `accept` as non-fatal
  ([ticket 7488]).
* Added a small block recycling optimisation to improve default memory
  allocation behaviour.

[heading Asio 1.8.2 / Boost 1.51]

* Fixed an incompatibility between `ip::tcp::iostream` and C++11
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7162 #7162]).
* Decorated GCC attribute names with underscores to prevent interaction
  with user-defined macros
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6415 #6415]).
* Added missing `#include <cctype>`, needed for some versions of MinGW.
* Changed to use [^gcc]'s atomic builtins on ARM CPUs, when available
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7140 #7140]).
* Changed strand destruction to be a no-op, to allow strand objects to be
  destroyed after their associated `io_service` has been destroyed.
* Added support for some newer versions of glibc which provide the
  `epoll_create1()` function but always fail with `ENOSYS`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7012 #7012]).
* Changed the SSL implementation to throw an exception if SSL engine
  initialisation fails
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6303 #6303]).
* Fixed another regression in `buffered_write_stream`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6310 #6310]).
* Implemented various minor performance improvements, primarily targeted at
  Linux x86 and x86-64 platforms.

[heading Asio 1.8.1 / Boost 1.50]

* Changed the `epoll_reactor` backend to do lazy registration for `EPOLLOUT`
  events.
* Fixed the `epoll_reactor` handling of out-of-band data, which was broken by
  an incomplete fix in the last release.
* Changed Asio's SSL wrapper to respect OpenSSL's `OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE` feature
  test `#define` ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6432 #6432]).
* Fixed `windows::object_handle` so that it works with Windows compilers that
  support C++11 move semantics (such as [^g++]).
* Improved the performance of strand rescheduling.
* Added support for [^g++] 4.7 when compiling in C++11 mode
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6620 #6620]).
* Fixed a problem where `signal_set` handlers were not being delivered when
  the `io_service` was constructed with a `concurrency_hint` of 1
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6657 #6657]).

[heading Asio 1.8.0 / Boost 1.49]

* Added a new class template `basic_waitable_timer` based around the C++11 clock
  type requirements. It may be used with the clocks from the C++11 `<chrono>`
  library facility or, if those are not available, Boost.Chrono. The typedefs
  `high_resolution_timer`, `steady_timer` and `system_timer` may be used to
  create timer objects for the standard clock types.
* Added a new `windows::object_handle` class for performing waits on Windows
  kernel objects. Thanks go to Boris Schaeling for contributing substantially
  to the development of this feature.
* On Linux, `connect()` can return EAGAIN in certain circumstances. Remapped
  this to another error so that it doesn't look like a non-blocking operation
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6048 #6048]).
* Fixed a compile error on NetBSD
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6098 #6098]).
* Fixed deadlock on Mac OS X
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6275 #6275]).
* Fixed a regression in `buffered_write_stream`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6310 #6310]).
* Fixed a non-paged pool "leak" on Windows when an `io_service` is repeatedly
  run without anything to do
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6321 #6321]).
* Reverted earlier change to allow some speculative operations to be performed
  without holding the lock, as it introduced a race condition in some
  multithreaded scenarios.
* Fixed a bug where the second buffer in an array of two buffers may be ignored
  if the first buffer is empty.

[heading Asio 1.6.1 / Boost 1.48]

* Implemented various performance improvements, including:
  * Using thread-local operation queues in single-threaded use cases (i.e. when
    `concurrency_hint` is 1) to eliminate a lock/unlock pair. 
  * Allowing some `epoll_reactor` speculative operations to be performed
    without holding the lock. 
  * Improving locality of reference by performing an `epoll_reactor`'s I/O
    operation immediately before the corresponding handler is called. This also
    improves scalability across CPUs when multiple threads are running the
    `io_service`. 
  * Specialising asynchronous read and write operations for buffer sequences
    that are arrays (`boost::array` or `std::array`) of exactly two buffers.
* Fixed a compile error in the regex overload of `async_read_until`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5688 #5688]).
* Fixed a Windows-specific compile error by explicitly specifying the
  `signal()` function from the global namespace
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5722 #5722]).
* Changed the `deadline_timer` implementation so that it does not read the
  clock unless the timer heap is non-empty.
* Changed the SSL stream's buffers' sizes so that they are large enough to hold
  a complete TLS record ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5854 #5854]).
* Fixed the behaviour of the synchronous `null_buffers` operations so that they
  obey the user's non-blocking setting
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5756 #5756]).
* Changed to set the size of the select `fd_set` at runtime when using Windows.
* Disabled an MSVC warning due to const qualifier being applied to function type.
* Fixed a crash that occurs when using the Intel C++ compiler
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5763 #5763]).
* Changed the initialisation of the OpenSSL library so that it supports all
  available algorithms.
* Fixed the SSL error mapping used when the session is gracefully shut down.
* Added some latency test programs.
* Clarified that a read operation ends when the buffer is full
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5999 #5999]).
* Fixed an exception safety issue in `epoll_reactor` initialisation
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6006 #6006]).
* Made the number of strand implementations configurable by defining
  `BOOST_ASIO_STRAND_IMPLEMENTATIONS` to the desired number.
* Added support for a new `BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_SEQUENTIAL_STRAND_ALLOCATION` flag
  which switches the allocation of strand implementations to use a round-robin
  approach rather than hashing.
* Fixed potential strand starvation issue that can occur when `strand.post()`
  is used.

[heading Asio 1.6.0 / Boost 1.47]

* Added support for signal handling, using a new class called `signal_set`.
  Programs may add one or more signals to the set, and then perform an
  `async_wait()` operation. The specified handler will be called when one of
  the signals occurs. The same signal number may be registered with multiple
  `signal_set` objects, however the signal number must be used only with Asio.
  Addresses [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2879 #2879].
* Added handler tracking, a new debugging aid. When enabled by defining
  `BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_HANDLER_TRACKING`, Asio writes debugging output to the
  standard error stream. The output records asynchronous operations and the
  relationships between their handlers. It may be post-processed using the
  included [^handlerviz.pl] tool to create a visual representation of the
  handlers (requires GraphViz).
* Added support for timeouts on socket iostreams, such as `ip::tcp::iostream`.
  A timeout is set by calling `expires_at()` or `expires_from_now()` to
  establish a deadline. Any socket operations which occur past the deadline
  will put the iostream into a bad state.
* Added a new `error()` member function to socket iostreams, for retrieving the
  error code from the most recent system call.
* Added a new `basic_deadline_timer::cancel_one()` function. This function lets
  you cancel a single waiting handler on a timer. Handlers are cancelled in
  FIFO order.
* Added a new `transfer_exactly()` completion condition. This can be used to
  send or receive a specified number of bytes even if the total size of the
  buffer (or buffer sequence) is larger.
* Added new free functions `connect()` and `async_connect()`. These operations
  try each endpoint in a list until the socket is successfully connected, and
  are useful for creating TCP clients that work with both IPv4 and IPv6.
* Extended the `buffer_size()` function so that it works for buffer sequences
  in addition to individual buffers.
* Added a new `buffer_copy()` function that can be used to copy the raw bytes
  between individual buffers and buffer sequences.
* Added new non-throwing overloads of `read()`, `read_at()`, `write()` and
  `write_at()` that do not require a completion condition.
* Added friendlier compiler errors for when a completion handler does not meet
  the necessary type requirements. When C++0x is available (currently supported
  for [^g++] 4.5 or later, and MSVC 10), `static_assert` is also used to
  generate an informative error message. This checking may be disabled by
  defining `BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_HANDLER_TYPE_REQUIREMENTS`.
* Added a new, completely rewritten SSL implementation. The new implementation
  compiles faster, shows substantially improved performance, and supports
  custom memory allocation and handler invocation. It includes new API features
  such as certificate verification callbacks and has improved error reporting.
  The new implementation is source-compatible with the old for most uses.
  However, if necessary, the old implementation may still be used by defining
  `BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_OLD_SSL`.
  Addresses [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3702 #3702],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3958 #3958].
* Changed the separate compilation support such that, to use Asio's SSL
  capabilities, you should also include `boost/asio/ssl/impl/src.hpp` in one
  source file in your program.
* Changed the SSL implementation to support build environments where SSL v2 is
  explicitly disabled ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5453 #5453]).
* Made the `is_loopback()`, `is_unspecified()` and `is_multicast()` functions
  consistently available across the `ip::address`, `ip::address_v4` and
  `ip::address_v6` classes
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3939 #3939]).
* Added new `non_blocking()` functions for managing the non-blocking behaviour
  of a socket or descriptor. The `io_control()` commands named `non_blocking_io`
  are now deprecated in favour of these new functions.
* Added new `native_non_blocking()` functions for managing the non-blocking
  mode of the underlying socket or descriptor. These functions are intended to
  allow the encapsulation of arbitrary non-blocking system calls as
  asynchronous operations, in a way that is transparent to the user of the
  socket object. The functions have no effect on the behaviour of the
  synchronous operations of the socket or descriptor.
* Added the `io_control()` member function for socket acceptors
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3297 #3297]).
* Added a `release()` member function to posix descriptors. This function
  releases ownership of the underlying native descriptor to the caller.
  Addresses [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3900 #3900].
* Added support for sequenced packet sockets (`SOCK_SEQPACKET`).
* Added a new `io_service::stopped()` function that can be used to determine
  whether the `io_service` has stopped (i.e. a `reset()` call is needed prior
  to any further calls to `run()`, `run_one()`, `poll()` or `poll_one()`).
* For consistency with the C++0x standard library, deprecated the `native_type`
  typedefs in favour of `native_handle_type`, and the `native()` member
  functions in favour of `native_handle()`.
* Added support for C++0x move construction and assignment to sockets, serial
  ports, POSIX descriptors and Windows handles.
* Reduced the copying of handler function objects.
* Added support for C++0x move construction to further reduce (and in some
  cases eliminate) copying of handler objects.
* Added support for the `fork()` system call. Programs that use `fork()` must
  call `io_service.notify_fork()` at the appropriate times. Two new examples
  have been added showing how to use this feature. Addresses
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3238 #3238],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4162 #4162].
* Cleaned up the handling of errors reported by the `close()` system call. In
  particular, assume that most operating systems won't have `close()` fail with
  `EWOULDBLOCK`, but if it does then set the blocking mode and restart the call.
  If any other error occurs, assume the descriptor is closed. Addresses
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3307 #3307].
* Added new `asio::buffer()` overloads for `std::array`, when available.
* Changed the implementation to use the C++0x standard library templates
  `array`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr` and `atomic` when they are available,
  rather than the Boost equivalents.
* Use C++0x variadic templates when available, rather than generating function
  overloads using Boost.Preprocessor.
* Changed exception reporting to include the function name in exception `what()`
  messages.
* Fixed insufficient initialisers warning with MinGW.
* Changed the `shutdown_service()` member functions to be private.
* Added archetypes for testing socket option functions.
* Changed the Boost.Asio examples so that they don't use Boost.Thread's
  convenience header. Use the header file that is specifically for the
  boost::thread class instead.
* Removed the dependency on OS-provided macros for the well-known IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses. This should eliminate annoying "missing braces around initializer"
  warnings ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3741 #3741]).
* Reduced the size of `ip::basic_endpoint<>` objects (such as
  `ip::tcp::endpoint` and `ip::udp::endpoint`).
* Changed the reactor backends to assume that any descriptors or sockets added
  using `assign()` may have been `dup()`-ed, and so require explicit
  deregistration from the reactor
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4971 #4971]).
* Removed the deprecated member functions named `io_service()`. The
  `get_io_service()` member functions should be used instead.
* Removed the deprecated typedefs `resolver_query` and `resolver_iterator` from
  the `ip::tcp`, `ip::udp` and `ip::icmp` classes.
* Modified the `buffers_iterator<>` and `ip::basic_resolver_iterator` classes
  so that the value_type typedefs are non-const byte types.
* Fixed warnings reported by g++'s [^-Wshadow] compiler option
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3905 #3905]).
* Added an explicit cast to convert the `FIONBIO` constant to int, to suppress
  a compiler warning on some platforms
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5128 #5128]).
* Changed most examples to treat a failure by an accept operation as non-fatal
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5124 #5124]).
* Fixed an error in the [^tick_count_timer] example by making the duration type
  signed. Previously, a wait on an already-passed deadline would not return for
  a very long time ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5418 #5418]).

[heading Asio 1.4.9 / Boost 1.46.1]

* `EV_ONESHOT` seems to cause problems on some versions of Mac OS X, with the
  `io_service` destructor getting stuck inside the `close()` system call.
  Changed the kqueue backend to use `EV_CLEAR` instead
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5021 #5021]).
* Fixed compile failures with some versions of [^g++] due to the use of
  anonymous enums ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4883 #4883]).
* Fixed a bug on kqueue-based platforms, where some system calls that
  repeatedly fail with `EWOULDBLOCK` are not correctly re-registered with
  kqueue.
* Changed `asio::streambuf` to ensure that its internal pointers are updated
  correctly after the data has been modified using `std::streambuf` member
  functions.
* Fixed a bug that prevented the linger socket option from working on platforms
  other than Windows.

[heading Asio 1.4.8 / Boost 1.46]

* Fixed an integer overflow problem that occurs when
  `ip::address_v4::broadcast()` is used on 64-bit platforms.
* Fixed a problem on older Linux kernels (where epoll is used without timerfd
  support) that prevents timely delivery of deadline_timer handlers, after the
  program has been running for some time
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5045 #5045]).

[heading Asio 1.4.7 / Boost 1.45]

* Fixed a problem on kqueue-based platforms where a `deadline_timer` may
  never fire if the `io_service` is running in a background thread
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4568 #4568]).
* Fixed a const-correctness issue that prevented valid uses of
  `has_service<>` from compiling
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4638 #4638]).
* Fixed MinGW cross-compilation
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4491 #4491]).
* Removed dependency on deprecated Boost.System functions
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4672 #4672]).
* Ensured `close()`\/`closesocket()` failures are correctly propagated
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4573 #4573]).
* Added a check for errors returned by `InitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4574 #4574]).
* Added support for hardware flow control on QNX
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4625 #4625]).
* Always use `pselect()` on HP-UX, if it is available
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4578 #4578]).
* Ensured handler arguments are passed as lvalues
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4744 #4744]).
* Fixed Windows build when thread support is disabled
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4680 #4680]).
* Fixed a Windows-specific problem where `deadline_timer` objects with expiry
  times set more than 5 minutes in the future may never expire
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4745 #4745]).
* Fixed the `resolver` backend on BSD platforms so that an empty service name
  resolves to port number `0`, as per the documentation
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4690 #4690]).
* Fixed read operations so that they do not accept buffer sequences of type
  `const_buffers_1` ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4746 #4746]).
* Redefined `Protocol` and `id` to avoid clashing with Objective-C++ keywords
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4191 #4191]).
* Fixed a `vector` reallocation performance issue that can occur when there are
  many active `deadline_timer` objects
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4780 #4780]).
* Fixed the kqueue backend so that it compiles on NetBSD
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4662 #4662]).
* Fixed the socket `io_control()` implementation on 64-bit Mac OS X and BSD
  platforms ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4782 #4782]).
* Fixed a Windows-specific problem where failures from `accept()` are
  incorrectly treated as successes
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4859 #4859]).
* Deprecated the separate compilation header `<boost/asio/impl/src.cpp>` in
  favour of `<boost/asio/impl/src.hpp>`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4560 #4560]).

[heading Asio 1.4.6 / Boost 1.44]

* Reduced compile times. (Note that some programs may need to add additional
  `#include`s, e.g. if the program uses `boost::array` but does not explicitly
  include `<boost/array.hpp>`.)
* Reduced the size of generated code.
* Refactored `deadline_timer` implementation to improve performance.
* Improved multiprocessor scalability on Windows by using a dedicated hidden
  thread to wait for timers.
* Improved performance of `asio::streambuf` with `async_read()` and 
  `async_read_until()`. These read operations now use the existing capacity of
  the `streambuf` when reading, rather than limiting the read to 512 bytes.
* Added optional separate compilation. To enable, add
  `#include <boost/asio/impl/src.cpp>` to one source file in a program, then
  build the program with `BOOST_ASIO_SEPARATE_COMPILATION` defined in the
  project\/compiler settings. Alternatively, `BOOST_ASIO_DYN_LINK` may be
  defined to build a separately-compiled Asio as part of a shared library.
* Added new macro `BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_FENCED_BLOCK` to permit the disabling of
  memory fences around completion handlers, even if thread support is enabled.
* Reworked timeout examples to better illustrate typical use cases.
* Ensured that handler arguments are passed as `const` types.
* Fixed incorrect parameter order in `null_buffers` variant of `async_send_to`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4170 #4170]).
* Ensured `unsigned char` is used with `isdigit` in `getaddrinfo` emulation
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4201 #4201]).
* Fixed handling of very small but non-zero timeouts
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4205 #4205]).
* Fixed crash that occurred when an empty buffer sequence was passed to a
  composed read or write operation.
* Added missing `operator+` overload in `buffers_iterator`
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4382 #4382]).
* Implemented cancellation of `null_buffers` operations on Windows.

[heading Asio 1.4.5 / Boost 1.43]

* Improved performance.
* Reduced compile times.
* Reduced the size of generated code.
* Extended the guarantee that background threads don't call user code to all
  asynchronous operations
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3923 #3923]).
* Changed to use edge-triggered epoll on Linux.
* Changed to use `timerfd` for dispatching timers on Linux, when available.
* Changed to use one-shot notifications with kqueue on Mac OS X and BSD
  platforms.
* Added a bitmask type `ip::resolver_query_base::flags` as per the TR2 proposal.
  This type prevents implicit conversion from `int` to `flags`, allowing the
  compiler to catch cases where users incorrectly pass a numeric port number as
  the service name.
* Added `#define NOMINMAX` for all Windows compilers. Users can define
  `BOOST_ASIO_NO_NOMINMAX` to suppress this definition
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3901 #3901]).
* Fixed a bug where 0-byte asynchronous reads were incorrectly passing an
  `error::eof` result to the completion handler
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4023 #4023]).
* Changed the `io_control()` member functions to always call `ioctl` on the
  underlying descriptor when modifying blocking mode
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3307 #3307]).
* Changed the resolver implementation to longer require the typedefs
  `InternetProtocol::resolver_query` and `InternetProtocol::resolver_iterator`,
  as neither typedef is part of the documented `InternetProtocol` requirements.
  The corresponding typedefs in the `ip::tcp`, `ip::udp` and `ip::icmp` classes
  have been deprecated.
* Fixed out-of-band handling for reactors not based on `select()`.
* Added new `BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_THREADS` macro that allows Asio's threading
  support to be independently disabled.
* Minor documentation improvements.

[heading Asio 1.4.4 / Boost 1.42]

* Added a new HTTP Server 4 example illustrating the use of stackless coroutines
  with Asio.
* Changed handler allocation and invocation to use `boost::addressof` to get the
  address of handler objects, rather than applying `operator&` directly
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2977 #2977]).
* Restricted MSVC buffer debugging workaround to 2008, as it causes a crash with
  2010 beta 2 ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3796 #3796],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3822 #3822]).
* Fixed a problem with the lifetime of handler memory, where Windows needs the
  `OVERLAPPED` structure to be valid until both the initiating function call
  has returned and the completion packet has been delivered.
* Don't block signals while performing system calls, but instead restart the
  calls if they are interrupted.
* Documented the guarantee made by strand objects with respect to order of
  handler invocation.
* Changed strands to use a pool of implementations, to make copying of strands
  cheaper.
* Ensured that kqueue support is enabled for BSD platforms
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3626 #3626]).
* Added a `boost_` prefix to the `extern "C"` thread entry point function
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3809 #3809]).
* In `getaddrinfo` emulation, only check the socket type (`SOCK_STREAM` or
  `SOCK_DGRAM`) if a service name has been specified. This should allow the
  emulation to work with raw sockets.
* Added a workaround for some broken Windows firewalls that make a socket
  appear bound to 0.0.0.0 when it is in fact bound to 127.0.0.1.
* Applied a fix for reported excessive CPU usage under Solaris
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3670 #3670]).
* Added some support for platforms that use older compilers such as g++ 2.95
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3743 #3743]).

[heading Asio 1.4.3 / Boost 1.40]

* Added a new ping example to illustrate the use of ICMP sockets.
* Changed the `buffered*_stream<>` templates to treat 0-byte reads and writes as
  no-ops, to comply with the documented type requirements for `SyncReadStream`,
  `AsyncReadStream`, `SyncWriteStream` and `AsyncWriteStream`.
* Changed some instances of the `throw` keyword to `boost::throw_exception()` to
  allow Asio to be used when exception support is disabled. Note that the SSL
  wrappers still require exception support
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2754 #2754]).
* Made Asio compatible with the OpenSSL 1.0 beta
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3256 #3256]).
* Eliminated a redundant system call in the Solaris [^/dev/poll] backend.
* Fixed a bug in resizing of the bucket array in the internal hash maps
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3095 #3095]).
* Ensured correct propagation of the error code when a synchronous accept fails
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3216 #3216]).
* Ensured correct propagation of the error code when a synchronous read or
  write on a Windows HANDLE fails.
* Fixed failures reported when `_GLIBCXX_DEBUG` is defined
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3098 #3098]).
* Fixed custom memory allocation support for timers
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3107 #3107]).
* Tidied up various warnings reported by g++
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/1341 #1341],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2618 #2618]).
* Various documentation improvements, including more obvious hyperlinks to
  function overloads, header file information, examples for the handler type
  requirements, and adding enum values to the index
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3157 #3157],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2620 #2620]).

[heading Asio 1.4.2 / Boost 1.39]

* Implement automatic resizing of the bucket array in the internal hash maps.
  This is to improve performance for very large numbers of asynchronous
  operations and also to reduce memory usage for very small numbers. A new
  macro `BOOST_ASIO_HASH_MAP_BUCKETS` may be used to tweak the sizes used for
  the bucket arrays. (N.B. this feature introduced a bug which was fixed in
  Asio 1.4.3 / Boost 1.40.)
* Add performance optimisation for the Windows IOCP backend for when no timers
  are used.
* Prevent locale settings from affecting formatting of TCP and UDP endpoints
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2682 #2682]).
* Fix a memory leak that occurred when an asynchronous SSL operation's
  completion handler threw an exception
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2910 #2910]).
* Fix the implementation of `io_control()` so that it adheres to the
  documented type requirements for IoControlCommand
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2820 #2820]).
* Fix incompatibility between Asio and ncurses.h
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2156 #2156]).
* On Windows, specifically handle the case when an overlapped `ReadFile` call
  fails with `ERROR_MORE_DATA`. This enables a hack where a
  `windows::stream_handle` can be used with a message-oriented named pipe
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2936 #2936]).
* Fix system call wrappers to always clear the error on success, as POSIX
  allows successful system calls to modify errno 
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2953 #2953]).
* Don't include termios.h if `BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_SERIAL_PORT` is defined
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2917 #2917]).
* Cleaned up some more MSVC level 4 warnings
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2828 #2828]).
* Various documentation fixes
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2871 #2871]).

[heading Asio 1.4.1 / Boost 1.38]

* Improved compatibility with some Windows firewall software.
* Ensured arguments to `windows::overlapped_ptr::complete()` are correctly
  passed to the completion handler
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2614 #2614]).
* Fixed a link problem and multicast failure on QNX
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2504 #2504],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2530 #2530]).
* Fixed a compile error in SSL support on MinGW / g++ 3.4.5.
* Drop back to using a pipe for notification if eventfd is not available at
  runtime on Linux ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2683 #2683]).
* Various minor bug and documentation fixes
  ([@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2534 #2534],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2541 #2541],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2607 #2607],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2617 #2617],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2619 #2619]).

[heading Asio 1.4.0 / Boost 1.37]

* Enhanced CompletionCondition concept with the signature
  `size_t CompletionCondition(error_code ec, size_t total)`, where the return
  value indicates the maximum number of bytes to be transferred on the next
  read or write operation. (The old CompletionCondition signature is still
  supported for backwards compatibility).
* New windows::overlapped_ptr class to allow arbitrary overlapped I/O
  functions (such as TransmitFile) to be used with Asio.
* On recent versions of Linux, an eventfd descriptor is now used (rather than
  a pipe) to interrupt a blocked select/epoll reactor.
* Added const overloads of lowest_layer().
* Synchronous read, write, accept and connect operations are now thread safe
  (meaning that it is now permitted to perform concurrent synchronous
  operations on an individual socket, if supported by the OS).
* Reactor-based io_service implementations now use lazy initialisation to
  reduce the memory usage of an io_service object used only as a message
  queue.

[heading Asio 1.2.0 / Boost 1.36]

* Added support for serial ports.
* Added support for UNIX domain sockets.
* Added support for raw sockets and ICMP.
* Added wrappers for POSIX stream-oriented file descriptors (excluding regular
  files).
* Added wrappers for Windows stream-oriented `HANDLE`s such as named pipes
  (requires `HANDLE`s that work with I/O completion ports).
* Added wrappers for Windows random-access `HANDLE`s such as files (requires
  `HANDLE`s that work with I/O completion ports).
* Added support for reactor-style operations (i.e. they report readiness but
  perform no I/O) using a new `null_buffers` type.
* Added an iterator type for bytewise traversal of buffer sequences.
* Added new `read_until()` and `async_read_until()` overloads that take a
  user-defined function object for locating message boundaries.
* Added an experimental two-lock queue (enabled by defining
  `BOOST_ASIO_ENABLE_TWO_LOCK_QUEUE`) that may provide better `io_service`
  scalability across many processors.
* Various fixes, performance improvements, and more complete coverage of the
  custom memory allocation support.

[heading Asio 1.0.0 / Boost 1.35]

First release of Asio as part of Boost.
