[section:SyncWriteStream Buffer-oriented synchronous write stream requirements]

In the table below, `a` denotes a synchronous write stream object, `cb` denotes
an object satisfying [link boost_asio.reference.ConstBufferSequence constant
buffer sequence] requirements, and `ec` denotes an object of type `error_code`.

[table Buffer-oriented synchronous write stream requirements
  [[operation] [type] [semantics, pre/post-conditions]]
  [
    [`a.write_some(cb);`]
    [`size_t`]
    [Equivalent to:
     ``
       error_code ec;
       size_t s = a.write_some(cb, ec);
       if (ec) throw system_error(ec);
       return s;
     ``]
  ]
  [
    [`a.write_some(cb, ec);`]
    [`size_t`]
    [
      Writes one or more bytes of data to the stream `a`.\n
      \n
      The constant buffer sequence `cb` specifies memory where the data to be
      written is located. The `write_some` operation shall always write a
      buffer in the sequence completely before proceeding to the next.\n
      \n
      If successful, returns the number of bytes written and sets `ec` such
      that `!ec` is true. If an error occurred, returns `0` and sets `ec` such
      that `!!ec` is true.\n
      \n
      If the total size of all buffers in the sequence `cb` is `0`, the
      function shall return `0` immediately.
