[section:DescriptorService Descriptor service requirements]

A descriptor service must meet the requirements for an [link
boost_asio.reference.IoObjectService I/O object service] with support for movability,
as well as the additional requirements listed below.

In the table below, `X` denotes a descriptor service class, `a` and `ao` denote
values of type `X`, `b` and `c` denote values of type `X::implementation_type`,
`n` denotes a value of type `X::native_handle_type`, `ec` denotes a value of type
`error_code`, `i` denotes a value meeting [link boost_asio.reference.IoControlCommand
`IoControlCommand`] requirements, and `u` and `v` denote identifiers.
