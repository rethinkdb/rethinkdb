[section:IoObjectService I/O object service requirements]

An I/O object service must meet the requirements for a [link
boost_asio.reference.Service service], as well as the requirements listed
below.

In the table below, `X` denotes an I/O object service class, `a` and `ao` denote
values of type `X`, `b` and `c` denote values of type `X::implementation_type`,
and `u` denotes an identifier.

     destructor.]

     initialised with `construct()` or `move_construct()`.]
