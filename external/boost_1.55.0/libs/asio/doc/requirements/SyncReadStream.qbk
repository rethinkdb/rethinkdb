[section:SyncReadStream Buffer-oriented synchronous read stream requirements]

In the table below, `a` denotes a synchronous read stream object, `mb` denotes
an object satisfying [link boost_asio.reference.MutableBufferSequence
mutable buffer sequence] requirements, and `ec` denotes an object of type
`error_code`.

  [
    [`a.read_some(mb);`]
    [`size_t`]
    [Equivalent to:
     ``
       error_code ec;
       size_t s = a.read_some(mb, ec);
       if (ec) throw system_error(ec);
       return s;
     ``]

  [
    [`a.read_some(mb, ec);`]
    [`size_t`]
    [
      Reads one or more bytes of data from the stream `a`.\n
      \n
      The mutable buffer sequence `mb` specifies memory where the data should
      be placed. The `read_some` operation shall always fill a buffer in the
      sequence completely before proceeding to the next.\n
      \n
      If successful, returns the number of bytes read and sets `ec` such that
      `!ec` is true. If an error occurred, returns `0` and sets `ec` such that
      `!!ec` is true.\n
      \n
      If the total size of all buffers in the sequence `mb` is `0`, the
      function shall return `0` immediately.
