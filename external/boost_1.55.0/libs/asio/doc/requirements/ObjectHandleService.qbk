[section:ObjectHandleService Object handle service requirements]

An object handle service must meet the requirements for a [link
boost_asio.reference.HandleService handle service], as well as the additional
requirements listed below.

In the table below, `X` denotes an object handle service class, `a` denotes a
value of type `X`, `b` denotes a value of type `X::implementation_type`, `ec`
denotes a value of type `error_code`, and `wh` denotes a value meeting [link
boost_asio.reference.WaitHandler `WaitHandler`] requirements.

[table ObjectHandleService requirements
  [[expression] [return type] [assertion/note\npre/post-condition]]
  [
    [`a.wait(b, ec);`]
    [`error_code`]
    [
      pre: `a.is_open(b)`.\n
      \n
      Synchronously waits for the object represented by handle `b` to become
      signalled.
    ]

  [
    [`a.async_wait(b, wh);`]
    [`void`]
    [
      pre: `a.is_open(b)`.\n
      \n
      Initiates an asynchronous operation to wait for the object represented by
      handle `b` to become signalled. The operation is performed via the
      `io_service` object `a.get_io_service()` and behaves according to [link
      boost_asio.reference.asynchronous_operations asynchronous operation]
      requirements.
