[section:WaitableTimerService Waitable timer service requirements]

A waitable timer service must meet the requirements for an [link
boost_asio.reference.IoObjectService I/O object service], as well as the
additional requirements listed below.

In the table below, `X` denotes a waitable timer service class for clock type
`Clock`, where `Clock` meets the C++11 clock type requirements, `a` denotes a
value of type `X`, `b` denotes a value of type `X::implementation_type`, `t`
denotes a value of type `Clock::time_point`, `d` denotes a value of type
`Clock::duration`, `e` denotes a value of type `error_code`, and `h` denotes a
value meeting [link boost_asio.reference.WaitHandler `WaitHandler`] requirements.

      Causes any outstanding asynchronous wait operations to complete as soon
      as possible. Handlers for cancelled operations shall be passed the error
      code `error::operation_aborted`. Sets `e` to indicate success or failure.
      Returns the number of operations that were cancelled.

      Initiates an asynchronous wait operation that is performed via the
      `io_service` object `a.get_io_service()` and behaves according to [link
      boost_asio.reference.asynchronous_operations asynchronous operation]
      requirements.\n
      \n
      The handler shall be posted for execution only if the condition
      `!!ec || !(Clock::now() < a.expires_at(b))`
      holds, where `ec` is the error code to be passed to the handler.
