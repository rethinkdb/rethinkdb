[section:RawSocketService Raw socket service requirements]

A raw socket service must meet the requirements for a [link
boost_asio.reference.SocketService socket service], as well as the additional
requirements listed below.

In the table below, `X` denotes a raw socket service class for protocol
[link boost_asio.reference.Protocol `Protocol`], `a` denotes a value of type
`X`, `b` denotes a value of type `X::implementation_type`, `e` denotes a value
of type `Protocol::endpoint`, `ec` denotes a value of type `error_code`, `f`
denotes a value of type `socket_base::message_flags`, `mb` denotes a value
satisfying [link boost_asio.reference.MutableBufferSequence mutable buffer
sequence] requirements, `rh` denotes a value meeting [link
boost_asio.reference.ReadHandler `ReadHandler`] requirements, `cb` denotes a
value satisfying [link boost_asio.reference.ConstBufferSequence constant
buffer sequence] requirements, and `wh` denotes a value meeting [link
boost_asio.reference.WriteHandler `WriteHandler`] requirements.
