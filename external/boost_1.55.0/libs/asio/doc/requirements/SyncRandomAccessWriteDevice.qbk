[section:SyncRandomAccessWriteDevice Buffer-oriented synchronous random-access
write device requirements]

In the table below, `a` denotes a synchronous random-access write device
object, `o` denotes an offset of type `boost::uint64_t`, `cb` denotes an object
satisfying [link boost_asio.reference.ConstBufferSequence constant buffer sequence]
requirements, and `ec` denotes an object of type `error_code`.

    [`a.write_some_at(o, cb);`]
    [`size_t`]
    [Equivalent to:
     ``
       error_code ec;
       size_t s = a.write_some(o, cb, ec);
       if (ec) throw system_error(ec);
       return s;

    [`a.write_some_at(o, cb, ec);`]
    [`size_t`]
    [
      Writes one or more bytes of data to the device `a` at offset `o`.\n
      \n
      The constant buffer sequence `cb` specifies memory where the data to be
      written is located. The `write_some_at` operation shall always write a
      buffer in the sequence completely before proceeding to the next.\n
      \n
      If successful, returns the number of bytes written and sets `ec` such
      that `!ec` is true. If an error occurred, returns `0` and sets `ec` such
      that `!!ec` is true.\n
      \n
      If the total size of all buffers in the sequence `cb` is `0`, the
      function shall return `0` immediately.
