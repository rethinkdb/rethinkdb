[section:reactor Reactor-Style Operations]

Sometimes a program must be integrated with a third-party library that wants to
perform the I/O operations itself. To facilitate this, Boost.Asio includes a
`null_buffers` type that can be used with both read and write operations. A
`null_buffers` operation doesn't return until the I/O object is "ready" to
perform the operation.

As an example, to perform a non-blocking read something like the
following may be used:

  ip::tcp::socket socket(my_io_service);
  ...
  socket.non_blocking(true);
  ...
  socket.async_read_some(null_buffers(), read_handler);
  ...
  void read_handler(boost::system::error_code ec)
  {
    if (!ec)
    {
      std::vector<char> buf(socket.available());
      socket.read_some(buffer(buf));
    }
  }
  
These operations are supported for sockets on all platforms, and for the POSIX
stream-oriented descriptor classes.
