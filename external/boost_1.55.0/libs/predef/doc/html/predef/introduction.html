      This library defines a set of compiler, architecture, operating system, library,
      and other version numbers from the information it can gather of C, C++, Objective
      C, and Objective C++ predefined macros or those defined in generally available
      headers. The idea for this library grew out of a proposal to extend the Boost
      Config library to provide more, and consistent, information than the feature
      definitions it supports. What follows is an edited version of that brief proposal.

    </h4>
<p>
      The idea is to define a set of macros to identify compilers and consistently
      represent their version. This includes:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
          A unique BOOST_VERSION_NUMBER(major,minor,patch) macro to specify version
          numbers (unfortunately, the name BOOST_VERSION is already taken to designate
          the version number of boost itself).
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          A compiler identification macro, suitable for use in <code class="computeroutput"><span class="preprocessor">#if</span></code>/<code class="computeroutput"><span class="preprocessor">#elif</span></code> directives, for each of the supported
          compilers. All macros would be defined, regardless of the compiler. The
          one macro corresponding to the compiler being used would be defined, in
          terms of BOOST_VERSION_NUMBER, to carry the exact compiler version. All
          other macros would expand to an expression evaluating to false (for instance,
          the token 0) to indicate that the corresponding compiler is not present.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          "Null values" could be set, for all macros, in boost/config/select_compiler.hpp;
          then, for each compiler the corresponding identification macro would be
          #undef and re-#defined in the corresponding boost/compiler/(cc).hpp; however
          in the context of the Boost.Config infrastructure using a "prefix"
          header (to be introduced) or boost/config/suffix.hpp is a better solution.

<p>
      The current Predef library is now, both an independent library, and expanded
      in scope. It includes detection and definition of architectures, compilers,
      languages, libraries, operating systems, and endianness. The key benefits are:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
          Version numbers that are always defined so that one doesn't have to guard

<li class="listitem">

<li class="listitem">

        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Predefs can be directly used in both preprocessor and compiler expressions
          for comparison to other similarly defined values.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          The headers are usable from multiple languages, that support the C preprocessor.
          In particular C++, C, Objective C, and Objective C++.

<h4>
<a name="predef.introduction.h2"></a>
      <span class="phrase"><a name="predef.introduction.design_choices"></a></span><a class="link" href="introduction.html#predef.introduction.design_choices">Design
      choices</a>
    </h4>
<p>
      An important design choice concerns how to represent compiler versions by means
      of a single integer number suitable for use in preprocessing directives. Let's
      do some calculation. The "basic" signed type for preprocessing constant-expressions
      is long in C90 (and C++, as of 2006) and intmax_t in C99. The type long shall
      at least be able to represent the number <code class="literal">+2 147 483 647</code>.
      This means the most significant digit can only be 0, 1 or 2; and if we want
      all decimal digits to be able to vary between 0 and 9, the largest range we
      can consider is <code class="literal">[0, 999 999 999]</code>. Distributing evenly, this
      means 3 decimal digits for each version number part.
    </p>
<p>
      So we can:
    </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
          use an uneven distribution or
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          use more bits (a larger type) or
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          use 3/3/3 and have the particular compiler/platform/stdlib deal with setting
          the numbers within the 3-digit range.
        </li>
</ol></div>
<p>
      It appears relatively safe to go for the first option and set it at 2/2/5.
      That covers CodeWarrior and others, which are up to and past 10 for the major
      number. Some compilers use the build number in lieu of the patch one; five
      digits (which is already reached by VC++ 8) seems a reasonable limit even in
      this case.
    </p>
<div class="note"><table border="0" summary="Note">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png"></td>
<th align="left">Note</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
        A 2/2/6 scheme would allow for bigger patch/build numbers at the cost, for
        instance, of limiting the major version number to 20 (or, with further constraints,
        to 21).
      </p></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>
      It might reassure the reader that this decision is actually encoded in one
      place in the code; the definition of <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">BOOST_VERSION_NUMBER</span></code>.

      work</a>
    </h4>
<p>
      Even though the basics of this library are done, there is much work that can
      be done:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
          Right now we limit the detection of libraries to known built-in predefined
          macros, and to guaranteed to exist system and library headers. It might
          be interesting to add something like auto-configuration predefs. This way
          we can add definitions for user specific libraries and features.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Along with the above, it might be good to add some user control as to which
          headers are included with the top-level header. Although in the current
          form of the library this is less of an issue as one can include the specific
          headers one needs.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Additionally, even if there is no auto-configure style option.. It would
          be good to add optionally included headers so that user can get consistent
          version number definitions for libraries they use.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Having a consistent set of version number definitions opens the door to
          improving the user level syntax of libraries that do checks against version
          numbers. Specifically Boost Config's <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">BOOST_WORKAROUND</span></code>
          macro would benefit from a more readable syntax. As would the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">BOOST_TESTED_AT</span></code> detail macro.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          And obviously there's lots of work to do in reformulating the existing
          Boost libraries to use the Predef library once it's accepted.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          And there's the continuing work of adding definitions for present and future
          compilers, platforms, architectures, languages, and libraries.
        </li>
