[section:non_std_strings Interfacing With Non-Standard String Types]

The Boost.Regex algorithms and iterators are all iterator-based, 
with convenience overloads of the algorithms provided that convert 
standard library string types to iterator pairs internally.  If you want 
to search a non-standard string type then the trick is to convert that string 
into an iterator pair: so far I haven't come across any string types that 
can't be handled this way, even if they're not officially iterator based.  
Certainly any string type that provides access to it's internal buffer, along 
with it's length, can be converted into a pair of pointers (which can be 
used as iterators).

Some non-standard string types are sufficiently common that wappers have been 
provided for them already: currently this includes the ICU and MFC string class
types.
