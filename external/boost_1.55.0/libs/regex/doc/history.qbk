[h4 Boost 1.42]

* Added support for Functors rather than strings as format expressions.
* Improved error reporting when throwing exceptions to include better more relevant information.
* Improved performance and reduced stack usage of recursive expressions.
* Fixed tickets

[@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3764 #3764]

[h4 Boost 1.40]

* Added support for many Perl 5.10 syntax elements including named
sub-expressions, branch resets and recursive regular expressions.

[h4 Boost 1.38]

* [*Breaking change]: empty expressions, and empty alternatives are now
allowed when using the Perl regular expression syntax.  This change has
been added for Perl compatibility, when the new [syntax_option_type]
['no_empty_expressions] is set then the old behaviour is preserved and
empty expressions are prohibited.  This is issue
[@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/1081 #1081].
* Added support for Perl style ${n} expressions in format strings
(issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2556 #2556]).
* Added support for accessing the location of sub-expressions within the
regular expression string 
(issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2269 #2269]).
* Fixed compiler compatibility issues 
[@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2244 #2244],
[@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2514 #2514],
and
[@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2244 #2458].


[h4 Boost 1.34]

* Fix for non-greedy repeats and partial matches not working correctly in some cases.
* Fix for non-greedy repeats on VC++ not working in some cases (bug report 1515830).
* Changed match_results::position() to return a valid result when *this represents a partial match.
* Fixed the grep and egrep options so that the newline character gets treated the same as |.

[h4 Boost 1.33.1]

* Fixed broken makefiles.
* Fixed configuration setup to allow building with VC7.1 - STLport-4.6.2 when using /Zc:wchar_t.
* Moved declarations class-inline in static_mutex.hpp so that SGI Irix compiler can cope.
* Added needed standard library #includes to fileiter.hpp, regex_workaround.hpp and cpp_regex_traits.hpp.
* Fixed a bug where non-greedy repeats could in certain strange curcumstances repeat more times than their maximum value.
* Fixed the value returned by basic_regex<>::empty() from a default constructed object.
* Changed the deffinition of regex_error to make it backwards compatible with Boost-1.32.0.
* Disabled external templates for Intel C++ 8.0 and earlier - otherwise unresolved references can occur.
* Rewritten extern template code for gcc so that only specific member functions are exported: otherwise strange unresolved references can occur when linking and mixing debug and non-debug code.
* Initialise all the data members of the unicode_iterators: this keeps gcc from issuing needless warnings.
* Ported the ICU integration code to VC6 and VC7.
* Ensured code is STLport debug mode clean.
* Fixed lookbehind assertions so that fixed length repeats are permitted, and so that regex iteration allows lookbehind to look back before the current search range (into the last match).
* Fixed strange bug with non-greedy repeats inside forward lookahead assertions.
* Enabled negated character classes inside character sets.
* Fixed regression so that [a-z-] is a valid expression again.
* Fixed bug that allowed some invalid expressions to be accepted.

[h4 Boost 1.33.0]

* Completely rewritten expression parsing code, and traits class support; now conforms to the standardization proposal.
* Breaking Change: The syntax options that can be passed to basic_regex constructors have been rationalized.  The default option (perl) now has a value of zero, and it is now clearly documented which options apply to which regular expression syntax styles (perl, POSIX-extended, POSIX-basic etc).  Some of the more esoteric options have now been removed, so there is the possibility that existing code may fail to compile: however equivalent functionality should still be available.
* Breaking Change: POSIX-extended and POSIX-basic regular expressions now enforce the letter of the POSIX standard much more closely than before.
* Added support for (?imsx-imsx) constructs.
* Added support for lookbehind expressions (?<=positive-lookbehind) and (?<!negative-lookbehind).
* Added support for conditional expressions (?(assertion)true-expresion|false-expression).
* Added MFC/ATL string wrappers.
* Added Unicode support; based on ICU.
* Changed newline support to recognise \\f as a line separator (all character types), and \\x85 as a line separator for wide characters / Unicode only.
* Added a new format flag format_literal that treats the replace string as a literal, rather than a Perl or Sed style format string.
* Errors are now reported by throwing exceptions of type regex_error. The types used previously - bad_expression and bad_pattern - are now just typedefs for regex_error. Type regex_error has a couple of new members: code() to report an error code rather than a string, and position() to report where in the expression the error occurred.

[h4 Boost 1.32.1]

* Fixed bug in partial matches of bounded repeats of '.'.

[h4 Boost 1.31.0]

* Completely rewritten pattern matching code - it is now up to 10 times faster than before.
* Reorganized documentation.
* Deprecated all interfaces that are not part of the regular expression standardization proposal.
* Added regex_iterator and regex_token_iterator .
* Added support for Perl style independent sub-expressions.
* Added non-member operators to the sub_match class, so that you can compare sub_match's with strings, or add them to a string to produce a new string.
* Added experimental support for extended capture information.
* Changed the match flags so that they are a distinct type (not an integer), if you try to pass the match flags as an integer rather than match_flag_type to the regex algorithms then you will now get a compiler error.
