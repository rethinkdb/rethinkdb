[section:sed_format Sed Format String Syntax]

Sed-style format strings treat all characters as literals except:

[table
[[character][description]]
[[&][The ampersand character is replaced in the output stream by 
   the the whole of what matched the regular expression.  Use
   \\& to output a literal '&' character.]]
[[\\][Specifies an escape sequence.]]
]

An escape character followed by any character x, outputs that character unless x 
is one of the escape sequences shown below.

[table
[[Escape][Meaning]]
[[\\a][Outputs the bell character: '\\a'.]]
[[\\e][Outputs the ANSI escape character (code point 27).]]
[[\\f][Outputs a form feed character: '\\f']]
[[\\n][Outputs a newline character: '\\n'.]]
[[\\r][Outputs a carriage return character: '\\r'.]]
[[\\t][Outputs a tab character: '\\t'.]]
[[\\v][Outputs a vertical tab character: '\\v'.]]
[[\\xDD][Outputs the character whose hexadecimal code point is 0xDD]]
[[\\x{DDDD}][Outputs the character whose hexadecimal code point is 0xDDDDD]]
[[\\cX][Outputs the ANSI escape sequence "escape-X".]]
[[\\D][If D is a decimal digit in the range 1-9, then outputs the text that matched sub-expression D.]]
