[section:syntax Regular Expression Syntax]

This section covers the regular expression syntax used by this library, 
this is a programmers guide, the actual syntax presented to your program's 
users will depend upon the flags used during expression compilation.

There are three main syntax options available, depending upon how you 
construct the regular expression object:

* [link boost_regex.syntax.perl_syntax Perl (this is the default behavior)].
* [link boost_regex.syntax.basic_extended POSIX extended (including the egrep and awk variations)].
* [link boost_regex.syntax.basic_syntax POSIX Basic (including the grep and emacs variations)].

You can also construct a regular expression that treats every character as a 
literal, but that's not really a "syntax"!

[include syntax_perl.qbk]
[include syntax_extended.qbk]
[include syntax_basic.qbk]
[include character_class_names.qbk]
[include collating_names.qbk]
[include leftmost_longest.qbk]
