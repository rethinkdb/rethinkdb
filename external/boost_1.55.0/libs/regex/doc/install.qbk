[section:install Building and Installing the Library]

When you extract the library from its zip file, you must preserve its internal 
directory structure (for example by using the -d option when extracting). If you 
didn't do that when extracting, then you'd better stop reading this, delete the 
files you just extracted, and try again!

This library should not need configuring before use; most popular compilers\/standard 
libraries\/platforms are already supported "as is". If you do experience configuration 
problems, or just want to test the configuration with your compiler, then the 
process is the same as for all of boost; see the 
[@../../../config/index.html configuration library documentation].

The library will encase all code inside namespace boost.

Unlike some other template libraries, this library consists of a mixture of 
template code (in the headers) and static code and data (in cpp files). 
Consequently it is necessary to build the library's support code into a 
library or archive file before you can use it, instructions for specific 
platforms are as follows:

[h4 Building with bjam]

This is now the preferred method for building and installing this library, 
please refer to the 
[@../../../../more/getting_started.html getting started guide] for more information.

[h4 Building With Unicode and ICU Support]

Boost.Regex is now capable of performing a configuration check
to test whether ICU is already installed in your compiler's
search paths.  When you build you should see a message like
this:

   Performing configuration checks

       - has_icu builds           : yes

Whick means that ICU has been found, and support for it will be enabled
in the library build.  

[tip If you don't want the regex library to use ICU then build with the 
"--disable-icu" command line option.]

If instead you see:

   Performing configuration checks

       - has_icu builds           : no

Then ICU was not found and support for it will not be compiled into the library.
If you think that it should have been found, then you will need to take a look
at the contents of the file ['boost-root/bin.v2/config.log] for the actual error
messages obtained when the build carried out the configuration check.  You will
then need to fix these errors by ensuring your compiler gets invoked with the correct
options, for example:

[pre bjam include=some-include-path --toolset=toolset-name install]

will add "some-include-path" to your compilers header include path, or if ICU
has been built with non-standard names for it's binaries, then:

[pre bjam -sICU_LINK="linker-options-for-icu" --toolset=toolset-name install]

Will use ['"linker-options-for-icu"] when linking the library rather than the default
ICU binary names.

You might also need to use the options "cxxflags=-option" and "linkflags=-option" to set compiler and linker
specific options.

[important Configuration results are cached - if you try rebuilding with different compiler
options then add an "-a" to the bjam command line to force all targets to be rebuilt.]

If ICU is not already in your compiler's path, but instead headers, libraries and binaries
are located at ['path-to-icu/include], ['path-to-icu/lib] and ['path-to-icu/bin] respectively
then you need to set the environment variable `ICU_PATH` to point to the root directory of your 
ICU installation: this typically happens if you're building with MSVC. 
For example if ICU was installed to `c:\download\icu` you 
might use:

[pre bjam -sICU_PATH=c:\download\icu --toolset=toolset-name install]

[important ICU is a C++ library just like Boost is, as such your copy of 
ICU must have been built with the same C++ compiler (and compiler version) 
that you are using to build Boost.  Boost.Regex will not work correctly unless 
you ensure that this is the case: it is up to you to ensure that the version 
of ICU you are using is binary compatible with the toolset you use to build Boost.]

And finally, if you want to build/test with multiple compiler versions, all with different ICU
builds, then the only way to achieve that currently is to modify your user-config.jam so that
each toolset has the necessary compiler/linker options set so that ICU is found automatically
by the configuration step (providing the ICU binaries use the standard names, all you have to
add is the appropriate header-include and linker-search paths).

[h4 Building from Source]

The Regex library is "just a bunch of source files": nothing special is required to build them.

You can either build the files under boost-path/libs/regex/src/*.cpp as a library, or add them
directly to your project.  This is particularly useful if you need to use specific compiler
options not supported by the default Boost build.

There are two #defines you should be aware of:

* BOOST_HAS_ICU should be defined if you want ICU support compiled in.
* BOOST_REGEX_DYN_LINK should be defined if you are building a DLL on Windows.

[important The makefiles that were supplied with Boost.Regex are now deprecated and will be removed in the next release.]
