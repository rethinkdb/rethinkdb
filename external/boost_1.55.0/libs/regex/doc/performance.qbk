[section:performance Performance]

The performance of Boost.Regex in both recursive and non-recursive modes 
should be broadly comparable to other regular expression libraries: 
recursive mode is slightly faster (especially where memory allocation requires 
thread synchronisation), but not by much.  The following pages compare 
Boost.Regex with various other regular expression libraries for the 
following compilers:

* [@../vc71-performance.html Visual Studio.Net 2003 (recursive Boost.Regex implementation)].
* [@../gcc-performance.html Gcc 3.2 (cygwin) (non-recursive Boost.Regex implementation)].
