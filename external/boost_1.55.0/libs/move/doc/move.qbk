[important To be able to use containers of movable-only  values you will need to use containers
supporting move semantics, like [*Boost.Container] containers]

[section:what_is_boost_move What is Boost.Move?]

Rvalue references are a major C++0x feature, enabling move semantics for C++ values. However, we
don't need C++0x compilers to take advantage of move semanatics. [*Boost.Move] emulates C++0x
move semantics in C++03 compilers and allows writing portable code that works optimally in C++03 
and C++0x compilers.

Copying can be expensive. For example, for vectors `v2=v1` typically involves a function call,
a memory allocation, and a loop. This is of course acceptable where we actually need two copies of
a vector, but in many cases, we don't: We often copy a `vector` from one place to another, just to
proceed to overwrite the old copy. Consider: 

[c++]

   template <class T> void swap(T& a, T& b)
   {
      T tmp(a);   // now we have two copies of a
      a = b;      // now we have two copies of b
      b = tmp;    // now we have two copies of tmp (aka a)
   }

But, we didn't want to have any copies of a or b, we just wanted to swap them. Let's try again: 

[c++]

   template <class T> void swap(T& a, T& b)
   {
      T tmp(::boost::move(a));
      a = ::boost::move(b);   
      b = ::boost::move(tmp);
   }

This `move()` gives its target the value of its argument, but is not obliged to preserve the value
of its source. So, for a `vector`, `move()` could reasonably be expected to leave its argument as
a zero-capacity vector to avoid having to copy all the elements. In other words, [*move is a potentially
destructive copy].

In this particular case, we could have optimized swap by a specialization. However, we can't
specialize every function that copies a large object just before it deletes or overwrites it. That
would be unmanageable. 

In C++0x, move semantics are implemented with the introduction of rvalue references. They allow us to
implement `move()` without verbosity or runtime overhead. [*Boost.Move] is a library that offers tools
to implement those move semantics not only in compilers with `rvalue references` but also in compilers
conforming to C++03.

[section:implementing_movable_classes Implementing copyable and movable classes]

[import ../example/doc_clone_ptr.cpp]

[section:copyable_and_movable_cpp0x Copyable and movable classes in C++0x]

Consider a simple handle class that owns a resource and also provides copy semantics
(copy constructor and assignment). For example a `clone_ptr` might own a pointer, and call
`clone()` on it for copying purposes: 

[c++]

   template <class T>
   class clone_ptr
   {
      private:
      T* ptr;

      public:
      // construction
      explicit clone_ptr(T* p = 0) : ptr(p) {}

      // destruction
      ~clone_ptr() { delete ptr; }

      // copy semantics
      clone_ptr(const clone_ptr& p)
         : ptr(p.ptr ? p.ptr->clone() : 0) {}

      clone_ptr& operator=(const clone_ptr& p)
      {
         if (this != &p)
         {
            T *p = p.ptr ? p.ptr->clone() : 0;
            delete ptr;
            ptr = p;
         }
         return *this;
      }

      // move semantics
      clone_ptr(clone_ptr&& p)
         : ptr(p.ptr) { p.ptr = 0; }

      clone_ptr& operator=(clone_ptr&& p)
      {
         if(this != &p)
         {
            std::swap(ptr, p.ptr);
            delete p.ptr;
            p.ptr = 0;
         }
         return *this;
      }

      // Other operations...
   };

`clone_ptr` has expected copy constructor and assignment semantics, duplicating resources when copying.
Note that copy constructing or assigning a `clone_ptr` is a relatively expensive operation: 

[copy_clone_ptr]

`clone_ptr` is code that you might find in today's books on C++, except for the part marked as
`move semantics`. That part is implemented in terms of C++0x `rvalue references`. You can find
some good introduction and tutorials on rvalue references in these papers:

*  [@http://www.artima.com/cppsource/rvalue.html ['A Brief Introduction to Rvalue References]]
*  [@http://blogs.msdn.com/vcblog/archive/2009/02/03/rvalue-references-c-0x-features-in-vc10-part-2.aspx ['Rvalue References: C++0x Features in VC10, Part 2]]

When the source of the copy is known to be an `rvalue` (e.g.: a temporary object), one can avoid the
potentially expensive `clone()` operation by pilfering source's pointer (no one will notice!). The move
constructor above does exactly that, leaving the rvalue in a default constructed state. The move assignment
operator simply does the same freeing old resources.

Now when code tries to copy an rvalue `clone_ptr`, or if that code explicitly gives permission to
consider the source of the copy an rvalue (using `boost::move`), the operation will execute much faster.

[section:copyable_and_movable_cpp03 Copyable and movable classes in portable syntax for both C++03 and C++0x compilers]

Many aspects of move semantics can be emulated for compilers not supporting `rvalue references`
and [*Boost.Move] offers tools for that purpose. With [*Boost.Move] we can write `clone_ptr`
so that it will work both in compilers with rvalue references and those who conform to C++03.
You just need to follow these simple steps:

* Put the following macro in the [*private] section:
  [macroref BOOST_COPYABLE_AND_MOVABLE BOOST_COPYABLE_AND_MOVABLE(classname)]
* Leave copy constructor as is.
* Write a copy assignment taking the parameter as
  [macroref BOOST_COPY_ASSIGN_REF BOOST_COPY_ASSIGN_REF(classname)]
* Write a move constructor and a move assignment taking the parameter as
  [macroref BOOST_RV_REF BOOST_RV_REF(classname)]

Let's see how are applied to `clone_ptr`:

[clone_ptr_def]

[endsect]

[*Question]: What about types that don't own resources? (E.g. `std::complex`?) 

No work needs to be done in that case. The copy constructor is already optimal.

[endsect]

[section:composition_inheritance Composition or inheritance]

For classes made up of other classes (via either composition or inheritance), the move constructor
and move assignment can be easily coded using the `boost::move` function:

[clone_ptr_base_derived]

[important Due to limitations in the emulation code, a cast to `Base &` is needed before moving the base part in the move
constructor and call Base's move constructor instead of the copy constructor.]

Each subobject will now be treated individually, calling move to bind to the subobject's move
constructors and move assignment operators. `Member` has move operations coded (just like
our earlier `clone_ptr` example) which will completely avoid the tremendously more expensive
copy operations:

[clone_ptr_move_derived]

Note above that the argument x is treated as a lvalue reference. That's why it is necessary to
say `move(x)` instead of just x when passing down to the base class. This is a key safety feature of move
semantics designed to prevent accidently moving twice from some named variable. All moves from 
lvalues occur explicitly.

[endsect]

[section:movable_only_classes Movable but Non-Copyable Types]

Some types are not amenable to copy semantics but can still be made movable. For example: 

*  `unique_ptr` (non-shared, non-copyable ownership) 
*  A type representing a thread of execution
*  A type representing a file descriptor

By making such types movable (though still non-copyable) their utility is tremendously
increased. Movable but non-copyable types can be returned by value from factory functions:

[c++]

   file_descriptor create_file(/* ... */);
   //...
   file_descriptor data_file;
   //...
   data_file = create_file(/* ... */);  // No copies!

In the above example, the underlying file handle is passed from object to object, as long
as the source `file_descriptor` is an rvalue. At all times, there is still only one underlying file
handle, and only one `file_descriptor` owns it at a time.

To write a movable but not copyable type in portable syntax, you need to follow these simple steps:

* Put the following macro in the [*private] section:
  [macroref BOOST_MOVABLE_BUT_NOT_COPYABLE BOOST_MOVABLE_BUT_NOT_COPYABLE(classname)]
* Write a move constructor and a move assignment taking the parameter as
  [macroref BOOST_RV_REF BOOST_RV_REF(classname)]

Here's the definition of `file descriptor` using portable syntax:

[import ../example/doc_file_descriptor.cpp]
[file_descriptor_def]

[/
 /Many standard algorithms benefit from moving elements of the sequence as opposed to
 /copying them. This not only provides better performance (like the improved `swap`
 /implementation described above), but also allows these algorithms to operate on movable
 /but non-copyable types. For example the following code sorts a `vector<unique_ptr<T>>`
 /based on comparing the pointed-to types: 
 /
 /[c++]
 /
 /   struct indirect_less
 /   {
 /      template <class T>
 /      bool operator()(const T& x, const T& y)
 /         {return *x < *y;}
 /   };
 /   ...
 /   std::vector<std::unique_ptr<A>> v;
 /   ...
 /   std::sort(v.begin(), v.end(), indirect_less());
 /
 /
 /As sort moves the unique_ptr's around, it will use swap (which no longer requires Copyability)
 /or move construction / move assignment. Thus during the entire algorithm, the invariant that
 /each item is owned and referenced by one and only one smart pointer is maintained. If the
 /algorithm were to attempt a copy (say by programming mistake) a compile time error would result. 
 /]

[endsect]

[section:move_and_containers Containers and move semantics]

Movable but non-copyable types can be safely inserted into containers and
movable and copyable types are more efficiently handled if those containers
internally use move semantics instead of copy semantics.
If the container needs to "change the location" of an element
internally (e.g. vector reallocation) it will move the element instead of copying it.
[*Boost.Container] containers are move-aware so you can write the following:

[file_descriptor_example]

[endsect]

[section:construct_forwarding Constructor Forwarding]

Consider writing a generic factory function that returns an object for a newly
constructed generic type. Factory functions such as this are valuable for encapsulating
and localizing the allocation of resources. Obviously, the factory function must accept
exactly the same sets of arguments as the constructors of the type of objects constructed:

[c++]

   template<class T> T* factory_new()
   {  return new T();  }

   template<class T> T* factory_new(a1)
   {  return new T(a1);  }

   template<class T> T* factory_new(a1, a2)
   {  return new T(a1, a2);  }

Unfortunately, in C++03 the much bigger issue with this approach is that the N-argument case
would require 2^N overloads, immediately discounting this as a general solution. Fortunately,
most constructors take arguments by value, by const-reference or by rvalue reference. If these
limitations are accepted, the forwarding emulation of a N-argument case requires just N overloads.
This library makes this emulation easy with the help of `BOOST_FWD_REF` and
`boost::forward`:

[import ../example/doc_construct_forward.cpp]
[construct_forward_example]

Constructor forwarding comes in handy to implement placement insertion in containers with
just N overloads if the implementor accepts the limitations of this type of forwarding for
C++03 compilers. In compilers with rvalue references perfect forwarding is achieved.

 /Consider writing a generic factory function that returns a std::shared_ptr for a newly

 /and localizing the allocation of resources. Obviously, the factory function must accept
 /exactly the same sets of arguments as the constructors of the type of objects constructed.
 /Today this might be coded as: 
 /
 /[c++]
 /
 /   template <class T>
 /   std::shared_ptr<T>
 /   factory()   // no argument version
 /   {

 /   {
 /      return std::shared_ptr<T>(new T(a1));
 /   }
 /
 /   // all the other versions
 /
 /
 /In the interest of brevity, we will focus on just the one-parameter version. For example: 
 /
 / [c++]
 /
 /    std::shared_ptr<A> p = factory<A>(5);
 /
 /
 / [*Question]: What if T's constructor takes a parameter by non-const reference? 
 /
 / In that case, we get a compile-time error as the const-qualifed argument of the factory
 / function will not bind to the non-const parameter of T's constructor. 
 /
 / To solve that problem, we could use non-const parameters in our factory functions: 
 /
 / [c++]
 /
 /    template <class T, class A1>
 /    std::shared_ptr<T>
 /    factory(A1& a1)
 /    {
 /       return std::shared_ptr<T>(new T(a1));
 /    }
 /
 /
 / This is much better. If a const-qualified type is passed to the factory, the const will
 / be deduced into the template parameter (A1 for example) and then properly forwarded to
 / T's constructor. Similarly, if a non-const argument is given to factory, it will be
 / correctly forwarded to T's constructor as a non-const. Indeed, this is precisely how
 /forwarding applications are coded today (e.g. `std::bind`). 
 /
 /However, consider: 
 /
 /[c++]
 /
 /   std::shared_ptr<A> p = factory<A>(5);	// error
 /   A* q = new A(5);	                // ok
 /
 /
 /This example worked with our first version of factory, but now it's broken: The "5"
 /causesthe factory template argument to be deduced as int& and subsequently will not
 /bind to the rvalue "5". Neither solution so far is right. Each breaks reasonable and
 /common code. 
 /
 /[*Question]: What about overloading on every combination of AI& and const AI&? 
 /
 /This would allow use to handle all examples, but at a cost of an exponential explosion:
 /For our two-parameter case, this would require 4 overloads. For a three-parameter factory
 /we would need 8 additional overloads. For a four-parameter factory we would need 16, and
 /so on. This is not a scalable solution. 
 /
 /Rvalue references offer a simple, scalable solution to this problem: 
 /
 /[c++]
 /
 /  template <class T, class A1>
 /  std::shared_ptr<T>
 /  factory(A1&& a1)
 /  {
 /     return std::shared_ptr<T>(new T(std::forward<A1>(a1)));
 /  }
 /
 / Now rvalue arguments can bind to the factory parameters. If the argument is const, that
 / fact gets deduced into the factory template parameter type. 
 /
 / [*Question]: What is that forward function in our solution? 
 /
 / Like move, forward is a simple standard library function used to express our intent
 / directly and explicitly, rather than through potentially cryptic uses of references.
 / We want to forward the argument a1, so we simply say so. 
 /
 / Here, forward preserves the lvalue/rvalue-ness of the argument that was passed to factory.
 / If an rvalue is passed to factory, then an rvalue will be passed to T's constructor with
 / the help of the forward function. Similarly, if an lvalue is passed to factory, it is
 / forwarded to T's constructor as an lvalue. 
 /
 / The definition of forward looks like this:

[section:move_iterator Move iterators]

[c++]

   template<class Iterator>
   class move_iterator;

   template<class It>
   move_iterator<It> make_move_iterator(const It &it);

[classref boost::move_iterator move_iterator] is an iterator adaptor with the
same behavior as the underlying iterator
except that its dereference operator implicitly converts the value returned by the
underlying iterator's dereference operator to an rvalue reference: `boost::move(*underlying_iterator)`
It is a read-once iterator, but can have up to random access traversal characteristics.

`move_iterator` is very useful because some generic algorithms and container insertion functions
can be called with move iterators to replace copying with moving. For example:

[import ../example/movable.hpp]
[movable_definition]

`movable` objects can be moved from one container to another using move iterators and insertion
and assignment operations.w

[import ../example/doc_move_iterator.cpp]
[move_iterator_example]

[endsect]

[section:move_inserters Move inserters]

Similar to standard insert iterators, it's possible to deal with move insertion in the same way
as writing into an array. A special kind of iterator adaptors, called move insert iterators, are
provided with this library. With regular iterator classes,

[c++]

   while (first != last) *result++ = *first++;

causes a range [first,last) to be copied into a range starting with result. The same code with
result being an move insert iterator will move insert corresponding elements into the container.
This device allows all of the copying algorithms in the library to work in the move insert mode
instead of the regular overwrite mode. This library offers 3 move insert iterators and their
helper functions:

[c++]

   // Note: C models Container
   template <typename C> 
   class back_move_insert_iterator;

   template <typename C>
   back_move_insert_iterator<C> back_move_inserter(C& x);

   template <typename C>
   class front_move_insert_iterator;

   template <typename C>
   front_move_insert_iterator<C> front_move_inserter(C& x);

   template <typename C>
   class move_insert_iterator;

   template <typename C>
   move_insert_iterator<C> move_inserter(C& x, typename C::iterator it);


A move insert iterator is constructed from a container and possibly one of its iterators pointing
to where insertion takes place if it is neither at the beginning nor at the end of the container.
Insert iterators satisfy the requirements of output iterators. `operator*` returns the move insert
iterator itself. The assignment `operator=(T& x)` is defined on insert iterators to allow writing
into them, it inserts x right before where the insert iterator is pointing. In other words, an
`insert iterator` is like a cursor pointing into the container where the insertion takes place.
`back_move_iterator` move inserts elements at the end of a container, `front_insert_iterator`
move inserts elements at the beginning of a container, and `move_insert_iterator` move inserts
elements where the iterator points to in a container. `back_move_inserter`, `front_move_inserter`,
and `move_inserter` are three functions making the insert iterators out of a container. Here's
an example of how to use them:

[import ../example/doc_move_inserter.cpp]
[move_inserter_example]

[endsect]

[section:move_algorithms Move algorithms]

The standard library offers several copy-based algorithms. Some of them, like `std::copy` or
`std::uninitialized_copy` are basic building blocks for containers and other data structures.
This library offers move-based functions for those purposes:

[c++]

  template<typename I, typename O> O move(I, I, O);
  template<typename I, typename O> O move_backward(I, I, O);
  template<typename I, typename F> F uninitialized_move(I, I, F);
  template<typename I, typename F> F uninitialized_copy_or_move(I, I, F);


The first 3 are move variations of their equivalent copy algorithms, but copy assignment and
copy construction are replaced with move assignment and construction. The last one has the
same behaviour as `std::uninitialized_copy` but since several standand library implementations
don't play very well with `move_iterator`s, this version is a portable version for those
willing to use move iterators.

[import ../example/doc_move_algorithms.cpp]
[move_algorithms_example]

[endsect]

[section:emulation_limitations Emulation limitations]

Like any emulation effort, the library has some limitations users should take in
care to achieve portable and efficient code when using the library with C++03 conformant compilers:

[section:emulation_limitations_base Initializing base classes]

When initializing base classes in move constructors, users must
cast the reference to a base class reference before moving it. Example:

[c++]

   //Portable and efficient
   Derived(BOOST_RV_REF(Derived) x)             // Move ctor
      : Base(boost::move(static_cast<Base&>(x))), 
        mem_(boost::move(x.mem_)) { }


If casting is not performed the emulation will not move construct
the base class, because no conversion is available from `BOOST_RV_REF(Derived)` 
to `BOOST_RV_REF(Base)`. Without the cast we might obtain a compilation
error (for non-copyable types) or a less-efficient move constructor (for copyable types):

[c++]

   //If Derived is copyable, then Base is copy-constructed.
   //If not, a compilation error is issued
   Derived(BOOST_RV_REF(Derived) x)             // Move ctor
      : Base(boost::move(x)),
        mem_(boost::move(x.mem_)) { } 

[endsect]

[section:template_parameters Template parameters for perfect forwarding]

The emulation can't deal with C++0x reference collapsing rules that allow perfect forwarding:

[c++]
   
   //C++0x
   template<class T>
   void forward_function(T &&t)
   {  inner_function(std::forward<T>(t); }

   //Wrong C++03 emulation
   template<class T>
   void forward_function(BOOST_RV_REF<T> t)
   {  inner_function(boost::forward<T>(t); }

In C++03 emulation BOOST_RV_REF doesn't catch any const rlvalues. For more details on
forwarding see [link move.construct_forwarding Constructor Forwarding] chapter.

[endsect]

[section:emulation_limitations_binding Binding of rvalue references to lvalues]

The 
[@http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1690.html first rvalue reference]
proposal allowed the binding of rvalue references to lvalues:

[c++]

   func(Type &&t);
   //....
   
   Type t;  //Allowed
   func(t)


Later, as explained in
[@http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2008/n2812.html ['Fixing a Safety Problem with Rvalue References]]
this behaviour was considered dangerous and eliminated this binding so that rvalue references adhere to the
principle of type-safe overloading: ['Every function must be type-safe in isolation, without regard to how it has been overloaded]

[*Boost.Move] can't emulate this type-safe overloading principle for C++03 compilers:

[c++]

   //Allowed by move emulation
   movable m;
   BOOST_RV_REF(movable) r = m;

[endsect]

[section:assignment_operator Assignment operator in classes derived from or holding copyable and movable types]

The macro [macroref BOOST_COPYABLE_AND_MOVABLE BOOST_COPYABLE_AND_MOVABLE] needs to
define a copy constructor for `copyable_and_movable` taking a non-const parameter in C++03 compilers:

[c++]

   //Generated by BOOST_COPYABLE_AND_MOVABLE
   copyable_and_movable &operator=(copyable_and_movable&){/**/}

Since the non-const overload of the copy constructor is generated, compiler-generated
assignment operators for classes containing `copyable_and_movable`
will get the non-const copy constructor overload, which will surely surprise users:

[c++]

   class holder
   {
      copyable_and_movable c;
   };

   void func(const holder& h)
   {
      holder copy_h(h); //<--- ERROR: can't convert 'const holder&' to 'holder&'
      //Compiler-generated copy constructor is non-const:
      // holder& operator(holder &)
      //!!!
   }

This limitation forces the user to define a const version of the copy assignment,
in all classes holding copyable and movable classes which might annoying in some cases.

An alternative is to implement a single `operator =()` for copyable and movable  classes
[@http://cpp-next.com/archive/2009/08/want-speed-pass-by-value/ using "pass by value" semantics]:

[c++]

   T& operator=(T x)    // x is a copy of the source; hard work already done
   {
      swap(*this, x);  // trade our resources for x's
      return *this;    // our (old) resources get destroyed with x
   }

However, "pass by value" is not optimal for classes (like containers, strings, etc.) that reuse resources
(like previously allocated memory) when x is assigned from a lvalue.

[endsect]

[endsect]

[section:how_the_library_works How the library works]

[*Boost.Move] is based on macros that are expanded to true rvalue references in C++0x compilers
and emulated rvalue reference classes and conversion operators in C++03 compilers.

In C++03 compilers [*Boost.Move] defines a class named `::boost::rv`:

[c++]

   template <class T>
   class rv : public T
   {
      rv();
      ~rv();
      rv(rv const&);
      void operator=(rv const&);
   };

which is convertible to the movable base class (usual C++ derived to base conversion). When users mark
their classes as [macroref BOOST_MOVABLE_BUT_NOT_COPYABLE BOOST_MOVABLE_BUT_NOT_COPYABLE] or
[macroref BOOST_COPYABLE_AND_MOVABLE BOOST_COPYABLE_AND_MOVABLE], these macros define conversion
operators to references to `::boost::rv`:

[c++]

   #define BOOST_MOVABLE_BUT_NOT_COPYABLE(TYPE)\
      public:\
      operator ::boost::rv<TYPE>&() \
      {  return *static_cast< ::boost::rv<TYPE>* >(this);  }\

      {  return static_cast<const ::boost::rv<TYPE>* >(this);  }\
      private:\
      //More stuff...

[macroref BOOST_MOVABLE_BUT_NOT_COPYABLE BOOST_MOVABLE_BUT_NOT_COPYABLE] also declares a
private copy constructor and assignment. [macroref BOOST_COPYABLE_AND_MOVABLE BOOST_COPYABLE_AND_MOVABLE]
defines a non-const copy constructor `TYPE &operator=(TYPE&)` that forwards to a const version:

   #define BOOST_COPYABLE_AND_MOVABLE(TYPE)\
      public:\
      TYPE& operator=(TYPE &t)\
      {  this->operator=(static_cast<const ::boost::rv<TYPE> &>(const_cast<const TYPE &>(t))); return *this;}\
      //More stuff...

In C++0x compilers `BOOST_COPYABLE_AND_MOVABLE` expands to nothing and `BOOST_MOVABLE_BUT_NOT_COPYABLE`
declares copy constructor and assigment operator private.

When users define the [macroref BOOST_RV_REF BOOST_RV_REF] overload of a copy constructor/assignment, in
C++0x compilers it is expanded to a rvalue reference (`T&&`) overload and in C++03 compilers it is expanded
to a `::boost::rv<T> &` overload:

[c++]

   #define BOOST_RV_REF(TYPE) ::boost::rv< TYPE >& \

When users define the [macroref BOOST_COPY_ASSIGN_REF BOOST_COPY_ASSIGN_REF] overload,
it is expanded to a usual copy assignment (`const T &`) overload in C++0x compilers and
to a `const ::boost::rv &` overload in C++03 compilers:

[c++]

   #define BOOST_COPY_ASSIGN_REF(TYPE) const ::boost::rv< TYPE >&
   
As seen, in [*Boost.Move] generates efficient and clean code for C++0x move
semantics, without modifying any resolution overload. For C++03 compilers
when overload resolution is performed these are the bindings:

* a) non-const rvalues (e.g.: temporaries), bind to `::boost::rv< TYPE >&`
* b) const rvalue and lvalues, bind to `const ::boost::rv< TYPE >&`
* c) non-const lvalues (e.g. non-const references) bind to `TYPE&`

The library does not define the equivalent of
[macroref BOOST_COPY_ASSIGN_REF BOOST_COPY_ASSIGN_REF] for copy construction (say, `BOOST_COPY_CTOR_REF`)
because nearly all modern compilers implement RVO and this is much more efficient than any move emulation.
[funcref boost::move move] just casts `TYPE &` into `::boost::rv<TYPE> &`.

Here's an example that demostrates how different rlvalue objects bind to `::boost::rv` references in the
presence of three overloads and the conversion operators in C++03 compilers:

[import ../example/doc_how_works.cpp]
[how_works_example]

[section:thanks_to Thanks and credits]

Thanks to all that developed ideas for move emulation: the first emulation was based on Howard Hinnant
emulation code for `unique_ptr`, David Abrahams suggested the use of `class rv`,
and Klaus Triendl discovered how to bind const rlvalues using `class rv`.

Many thanks to all boosters that have tested, reviewed and improved the library.
