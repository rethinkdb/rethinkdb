<p>Special thanks to </p>
<p><b>Dan Nuffer</b> for his work on lexers, parse trees, ASTs, XML parsers, the
  multi-pass iterator as well as administering Spirit's site, editing, maintaining
  the CVS and doing the releases plus a zillion of other chores that were almost
  taken for granted. </p>
<p><b>Hartmut Kaiser</b> for his work on the C parser, the work on the C/C++ preprocessor,
  utility parsers, the original port to Intel 5.0, various work on Phoenix, porting
  to v1.5, the meta-parsers, the grouping-parsers, extensive testing and painstaking
  attention to details.</p>
<p><b>Martin Wille</b> who improved grammar multi thread safety, contributed the
  eol_p parser, the dynamic parsers, documentation and for taking an active role
  in almost every aspect from brainstorming and design to coding. And, as always, helps keep the regression tests for g++ on Linux as green as ever :-). </p>
<p><b>Martijn W. Van Der Lee</b> our Web site administrator and for contributing
  the RFC821 parser<b>.</b></p>
<p><b>Giovanni Bajo</b> for last minute tweaks of Spirit 1.8.0 for CodeWarrior
  8.3. Actually, I'm ashamed Giovanni was not in this list already. He's done
  a lot since Spirit 1.5, the first Boost.Spirit release. He's instrumental in
  the porting of the Spirit iterators stuff to the new Boost Iterators Library
  (version 2). He also did various bug fixes and wrote some tests here and there.
</p>
<p><b>Juan Carlos Arevalo-Baeza (JCAB) </b>for his work on the C++ parser, the
  position iterator, ports to v1.5 and keeping the mailing list discussions alive
  and kicking.</p>
<p><strong>Vaclav Vesely, </strong>lots of stuff, the no_actions directive, various patches fixes, the distinct parsers, the lazy parser, some phoenix tweaks and add-ons (e.g. <tt>new_</tt>). Also, <strong>Stefan&nbsp;Slapeta</strong> and <strong>wife</strong> for editing Vaclav's distinct parser doc. </p>
<p><b>Raghavendra Satish </b>for doing the original v1.3 port to VC++ and his
    work on Phoenix.</p>
<p><b>Noah Stein</b> for following up and helping Ragav on the VC++ ports.</p>
<p><b>Hakki Dogusan</b>, for his original v1.0 Pascal parser.</p>
<p><b>John (EBo) David</b> for his work on the VM and watching over my shoulder
  as I code giving the impression of distance eXtreme programming.</p>
<p><b>Chris Uzdavinis</b> for feeding in comments and valuable suggestions as
  well as editing the documentation.</p>
<p><b>Carsten Stoll</b>, for his work on dynamic parsers.</p>
<p><b>Andy Elvey</b> and his conifer parser.</p>
<p><b>Bruce Florman</b>, who did the original v1.0 port to VC++.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Westfahl </b>for porting the loop parsers to v1.5 and contributing
  the file iterator.</p>
<p><b>Peter Simons</b> for the RFC date parser example and tutorial plus helping
  out with some nitty gritty details.</p>
<p><b>Markus Sch&ouml;pflin</b> for suggesting the end_p parser and lots of other
  nifty things and his active presence in the mailing list.</p>
<p><b>Doug Gregor</b> for mentoring and his ability to see things that others
  don't. </p>
<p><strong>David Abrahams</strong> for giving me a job that allows me to still
  work on Spirit, plus countless advice and help on C++ and specifically template
  metaprogramming.</p>
<p><strong>Aleksey Gurtovoy</strong> for his MPL library from which I stole many
  metaprogramming tricks especially for less conforming compilers such as Borland
  and VC6/7.</p>
<p><strong>Gustavo Guerra</strong> for his last minute review of Spirit and constant
  feedback, plus patches here and there (e.g. proposing the new dot behavior of
  the real numerics parsers).</p>
<p><strong>Nicola Musatti, Paul Snively, Alisdair Meredith </strong>and<strong>
  Hugo Duncan </strong> for testing and sending in various patches.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Rowe</strong> for his splendid work on the TSTs that will soon
  be taken into Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan de Halleux</strong> for his work on actors.</p>
<p><strong>Angus Leeming</strong> for last minute editing work on the 1.8.0 release documentation, his work on Phoenix and his active presence in the Spirit mailing list.</p>
<p> <strong>Joao Abecasis</strong> for his active presence in the Spirit mailing list, providing user support, participating in the discussions and so on. </p>
<p> <strong>Guillaume Melquiond</strong> for a last minute patch to <tt>multi_pass</tt> for 1.8.1. </p>
<p> <strong>Peder Holt</strong> for his porting work on Phoenix, Fusion and Spirit to VC6. </p>
<p>To my wife <b>Mariel</b> who did the graphics in this document.</p>
<p>My, there's a lot in this list! And it's a continuing list. I add people to this list everytime. I hope I did not forget anyone. If I missed<br>
someone you know who has helped in any way, please inform me.</p>
<p> Special thanks also to people who gave feedback and valuable comments, particularly
  members of Boost and Spirit mailing lists. This includes all those who participated
