[section Acknowledgments]

The __spirit__ repository is the result of the contributions of active members 
of the Spirit community. We would like to express our thanks to all who 
directly contributed and to everybody directly or indirectly involved in the 
discussions, which led to the creation of the parser and generator components.

The following people have directly contributed code to this repository:

[*Aaron Graham] wrote the __qi_advance__ parser component, which allows the 
parser to skip (advance) through a specified number of iterations without 
performing unnecessary work.

[*Chris Hoeppler] submitted the __qi_confix__ parser directive allowing to 
embed a parser (the subject) inside an opening (the prefix) and a closing 
sequence (the suffix).

[*Francois Barel] contributed the __qi_subrule__ parser and __karma_subrule__ 
generator components, allowing to create a named parser or generator, and
to refer to it by name. These components are in fact fully static versions of 
the corresponding `rule` component.

[*Thomas Bernard] contributed the __qi_keywords__ and __qi_keywords_list__ 
parser components, allowing to define keyword parsers.
