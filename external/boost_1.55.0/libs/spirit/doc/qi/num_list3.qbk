[section Number List Redux - list syntax]


So far, we've been using the syntax:

    double_ >> *(',' >> double_)

to parse a comma-delimited list of numbers. Such lists are common in parsing and
Spirit provides a simpler shortcut for them. The expression above can be
simplified to:

    double_ % ','

read as: a list of doubles separated by `','`.


This sample, again a variation of our previous example, demonstrates just that:

[import ../../example/qi/num_list3.cpp]

[tutorial_numlist3]

The full cpp file for this example can be found here: [@../../example/qi/num_list3.cpp]
