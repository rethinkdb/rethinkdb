[section:action Semantic Actions with Generators]

[heading Description]

Semantic actions may be attached to any point in the grammar specification. 
They allow to call a function or function object in order to provide the value 
output by the generator attached to the semantic action.  Semantic 
actions are associated with a generator using the syntax `g[]`, where `g` is an
arbitrary generator expression.

[heading Header]

    // forwards to <boost/spirit/home/karma/action.hpp>
    #include <boost/spirit/include/karma_action.hpp>

Also, see __include_structure__.

[heading Model of]

[:__unary_generator_concept__]

[variablelist Notation
    [[`a`, `g`][Instances of a generator, `G`]]
    [[`A`]     [Attribute type exposed by a generator, `a`]]
    [[`fa`]    [A (semantic action) function with signature `void(Attrib&, Context&, bool&)`.
               The third parameter is a boolean flag that can be set to false to
               force the generator to fail. Both `Context` and the boolean flag are
               optional. For more information see below.]]
    [[`Attrib`][The attribute to be used to generate output from.]]
    [[`Context`]  [The type of the generator execution context. For more 
                information see below.]]
]

[heading Expression Semantics]

Semantics of an expression is defined only where it differs from, or is not
defined in __unary_generator_concept__.

[table
    [[Expression]       [Semantics]]
    [[`g[fa]`]          [Call semantic action, `fa` /before/ invoking `g`. The function
                         or function object `fa` is expected to provide the value
                         to generate output from to the generator `g`.]]
]

The possible signatures for functions to be used as semantic actions are:

    template <typename Attrib>
    void fa(Attrib& attr);

    template <typename Attrib, typename Context>
    void fa(Attrib& attr, Context& context);

    template <typename Attrib, typename Context>
    void fa(Attrib& attr, Context& context, bool& pass);

The function or function object is expected to return the value to generate 
output from by assigning it to the first parameter, `attr`. Here `Attrib` is 
the attribute type of the generator attached to the semantic action. 

The type `Context` is the type of the generator execution context. This type is 
unspecified and depends on the context the generator is invoked in. The value 
`context` is used by semantic actions written using __phoenix__ to access various 
context dependent attributes and values. For more information about __phoenix__ 
placeholder expressions usable in semantic actions see __karma_nonterminal_concept__.

The third parameter, `pass`, can be used by the semantic action to force the 
associated generator to fail. If pass is set to `false` the action generator 
will immediately return `false` as well, while not invoking `g` and not 
generating any output.

[heading Attributes]

[table
    [[Expression]       [Attribute]]
    [[`a[fa]`]          [`a: A --> a[fa]: A`]]
]

[heading Complexity]

The complexity of the action generator is defined by the complexity of the 
generator the semantic action is attached to and the complexity of the function
or function object used as the semantic action.

[important Please note that the use of semantic actions in __karma__ generally
           forces the library to create a /copy/ of the attribute, which might
           be a costly operation. Always consider using other means of 
           associating a value with a particular generator first.]
