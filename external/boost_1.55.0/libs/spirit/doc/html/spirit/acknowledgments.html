<p>
      This version of Spirit is a complete rewrite of the <span class="emphasis"><em>classic</em></span>
      Spirit many people have been contributing to (see below). But there are a couple
      of people who already managed to help significantly during this rewrite. We
      would like to express our special acknowledgement to (in no particular order):
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Eric Niebler</strong></span> for writing Boost.Proto, without
      which this rewrite wouldn't have been possible, and helping with examples,
      advice, and suggestions on how to use Boost.Proto in the best possible way.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Ben Hanson</strong></span> for providing us with an early
      version of his <a href="http://www.benhanson.net/lexertl.html" target="_top">Lexertl</a>
      library, which is proposed to be included into Boost (as Boost.Lexer). At the
      time of this writing the Boost review for this library is still pending.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Francois Barel</strong></span> for his silent but steady work
      on making and keeping Spirit compatible with all versions of gcc, older and
      newest ones. He not only contributed subrules to Spirit V2.1, but always keeps
      an eye on the small details which are so important to make a difference.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Andreas Haberstroh</strong></span> for proof reading the documentation
      and fixing those non-native-speaker-quirks we managed to introduce into the
      first versions of the documentation.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Chris Hoeppler</strong></span> for taking up the editorial
      tasks for the initial version of this documentation together with Andreas Haberstroh.
      Chris did a lot especially at the last minute when we are about to release.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Michael Caisse</strong></span> (a.k.a mjcaisse) for being
      Spirit's benevolent evangelist on freenode's #boost IRC . No Spirit question
      asked there stays without an answer because of his active involvement. Also,
      we would like to thank him for last minute editing work on the 2.1 release
      documentation.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Tobias Schwinger</strong></span> for proposing expectation
      points and GCC port of an early version.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Dave Abrahams</strong></span> as always, for countless advice
      and help on C++, library development, interfaces, usability and ease of use,
      for reviewing the code and providing valuable feedback and for always keeping
      us on our toes.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>OvermindDL</strong></span> for his creative ideas on the mailing
      list helping to resolve even more difficult user problems.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Carl Barron</strong></span> for his early adoption and valuable
      feedback on the Lexer library forcing us to design a proper API covering all
      of his use cases. He also contributed an early version of the variadic attribute
      API for Qi.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Daniel James</strong></span> for improving and maintaining
      Quickbook, the tool we use for this documentation. Also, for bits and pieces
      here and there such documentation suggestions and editorial patches.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Stephan Menzel</strong></span> for his early adoption of Qi
      and Karma and his willingness to invest time to spot bugs which were hard to
      isolate. Also, for his feedback on the documentation.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Ray Burkholder</strong></span> and <span class="bold"><strong>Dainis
      Polis</strong></span> for last minute feedback on the documentation.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Steve Brandt</strong></span> for his his effort trying to
      put Qi and Karma to some use while writing a source to source language transformation
      tool. He made many incredible suggestions helping to improve the usability
      of both libraries.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Bryce Leylbach</strong></span> (a.k.a. wash) for contributing
      the components <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">qi</span><span class="special">::</span></code><a class="link" href="qi/reference/directive/as.html" title="Parser Directives Forcing Atomic Assignment (as&lt;T&gt;, as_string[], as_wstring[])"><code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">as</span><span class="special">&lt;</span><span class="identifier">T</span><span class="special">&gt;[]</span></code></a>

      and its integration with Qi and Karma, for adding numeric parser literals,
      for contributing the related documentation, and for being a big help in the
      everyday maintenance of the library's (and our) sanity.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Mathias Gaunard</strong></span> for his bug reports, suggestions
      and regression test contributions to the Lexer helping to find subtle bugs
      and to improve its overall usability.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Thomas Bernard</strong></span> (a.k.a. teajay) for working

      <span class="bold"><strong>Dan Nuffer</strong></span> for his work on lexers, parse trees,
      ASTs, XML parsers, the multi-pass iterator as well as administering Spirit's
      site, editing, maintaining the CVS and doing the releases plus a zillion of
      other chores that were almost taken for granted.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Hartmut Kaiser</strong></span> for his work on the C parser,
      the work on the C/C++ preprocessor, utility parsers, the original port to Intel
      5.0, various work on Phoenix, porting to v1.5, the meta-parsers, the grouping-parsers,

      He's instrumental in the porting of the Spirit iterators stuff to the new Boost
      Iterators Library (version 2). He also did various bug fixes and wrote some
