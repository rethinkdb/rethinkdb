<h1>Layout Versus Schematic Tutorial</h1> 
<p>In this tutorial we will implement a toy VLSI layout verification 
application.&nbsp; In VLSI CAD an important step of design is the sign off check 
that verifies that the physical layout as drawn by mask designers and automated 
tools implements the logical schematic specified by design engineers.&nbsp; 
Physical layout is modeled as polygons on layers that are used to print the 
layout to the silicon wafer during manufacture.&nbsp; It is much better to find 
physical design mistakes before spending millions of dollars to prepare 
lithography masks and run a test lot of wafers.</p>
<p>Real layout file formats are binary and often compressed and represent a 
folded hierarchical model of layout where a group of polygons can be grouped 
into a cell and instantiated as a group into other cells.&nbsp; For this 
tutorial we assume a simplified ascii layout file format with no design 
hierarchy, which we would call &quot;flat&quot; in VLSI jargon.&nbsp; Similarly we assume 
a flat, ascii logical schematic net list file format.&nbsp; A net is a named 
electrical connection in a circuit design.&nbsp; The goal of the layout 
verification tutorial is to parse these two file formats, apply geometry 
operations provided by Boost.Polygon on the layout data to generate a logical 
schematic that represents what is implemented in the physical layout and then 
compare the input schematic with the generated schematic to determine whether 
they are the same.</p>
<p>First let us define some objects that we will need in the design of our toy 
layout verification application:</p>
<p>Layout Rectangle: An axis-parallel rectangle with a layer associated<br>
Layout Pin: An axis-parallel rectangle with a layer and net (electrical signal) 
name associated<br>
Layout Database: An associative container of layer name to polygon set<br>
Connectivity Database: An associative container of net name to layout database<br>
Physical Device: A specific geometric arrangement on several layers with one or 
more input net and one output net<br>
Logical Net: A named graph node<br>
Logical Device: An un-named graph node with a device type<br>
Logical Pin: A special net that defines an input or output for the circuit<br>
Schematic Database: A graph consisting of nets and logical 
devices</p>
<p>Next let's define the sequence of operations performed by our toy 
layout versus schematic application:</p>
<p>Parse Layout: Stream layout rectangles and polygons into a layout database 
and stream layout pins into a connectivity database<br>
Extract Connectivity: Add polygons from layout database to connectivity database 
by physical touch or overlap relationship<br>
Extract Devices: Populate a schematic database with logical devices based on 
physical devices identified within the layout geometry and extract their 
terminals from the 
connectivity database<br>
Extract Net List: Complete graph represented in schematic database derived from 
layout<br>
Parse Schematic: Stream logical nets, devices and pins into a schematic 
database<br>
Compare Schematics: Evaluate whether extracted schematic database is equivalent 
to input schematic database and output result</p>
<p>To test our application we will extract single logic gates.&nbsp; A logic 
gate is several transistors that work together to perform a specific logic 
function.&nbsp; Logic functions include the commonly understood Boolean logic 
operations such as Boolean AND, OR, XOR and INVERT.&nbsp; Also frequently used 
are NAND and NOR, which are respectively AND and OR operations followed by an 
INVERT operation.&nbsp; A NAND gate can be implemented in the CMOS circuit 
family with four transistors.&nbsp; The NAND gate has two inputs and one output.&nbsp; 
Each input goes to two transistors, one p-type transistor and one n-type 
transistor.&nbsp; The &quot;p&quot; stands for positive and the &quot;n&quot; stands for negative.&nbsp; 
When the p-type transistor is on 
it pulls the output up to the same voltage as the voltage source.&nbsp; When the 
n-type transistor is on it pulls the output down to the same voltage as the 
ground.&nbsp; The process of creating a p-type transistor begins by &quot;doping&quot; the silicon 
substrate to create n-type material.&nbsp; This area of n-type material will be 
called the NWELL layer in our test data.&nbsp; Within the area of NWELL a 
p-diffusion area is created by further doping the silicon to create p-type 
material.&nbsp; This area of p-type material will be called PDIFF in our test 
data.&nbsp; Through the middle of a PDIFF area bars of poly-silicon are grown 
that create conductive lines over the diffusion area.&nbsp; The area of 
poly-silicon material will be called POLY in our test data.&nbsp; Under some of these 
poly-silicon lines a thin layer of silicon-oxide provides insulation but allows 
the voltage field of the poly-silicon to interact with the diffusion.&nbsp; Each 
of these insulated poly-silicon lines is the &quot;gate&quot; of a transistor.&nbsp; 
The gate area will be called GATE in our test data.&nbsp; When the 
voltage at the gate is the same as the ground voltage the p-type transistor is 
&quot;on&quot; and can pass current from the voltage source to the output .&nbsp; The 
poly-silicon lines that are not insulated create electrical connections to the 
transistor for output signals and source voltage.&nbsp; The n-type transistor 
differs from the p-type in that its diffusion is n-type material outside of NWELL area.&nbsp; Current can pass from the output to the ground when the 
voltage at the gate of the n-type transistor is at the source voltage level.&nbsp; 
Above the poly-silicon layer is a layer of silicon-oxide insulator with holes 
cut out of it that get filled in with metal.&nbsp; These metal filled holes are 
called vias and we will refer to this layer as VIA0 in our test data.&nbsp; On 
top of VIA0 is a layer of metal polygons with silicon oxide insulator between 
them.&nbsp; These metal polygons are wires and we will call them METAL1 in our 
test data.&nbsp; The Layout Pins in our test data will be on METAL1.&nbsp; In a 
NAND gate the two n-type transistors are configured in series, meaning that the 
output of one is the input voltage source of the other.&nbsp; Only if both 
n-type transistors of a NAND gate are &quot;on&quot; will the output be connected to 
ground, signifying a logical &quot;false&quot;.&nbsp; The two p-type transistors in a NAND 
gate are configured in parallel.&nbsp; If either input to the NAND gate is a 
logical &quot;false&quot; the p-type transistor it is connected to will be &quot;on&quot; and the 
output of the gate will be a logical &quot;true&quot; because the transistor will connect 
it to the voltage supply.&nbsp; The diagram below is an example of how a NAND 
gate might be laid out and is not drawn to scale for any real process 
technology.&nbsp; The diffusion material is intended to be cut away under the 
gate material by a Boolean NOT operation and is represented as solid bars under 
the gates of transistors only for convenience of drawing.</p>

<p>A human can look at this schematic and compare it to the drawn layout of the 
NAND gate above to verify that the drawn layout matches what the schematic says 
in a few seconds.&nbsp; If you do that now you will probably find the p and 
n-type transistors and trace the connectivity of the inputs and power to the 
terminals of the transistors and then to the output.&nbsp; Since there are on 
the order of one billion transistors on a single chip these days we need to go a 
lot faster than humans can inspect layout and make fewer mistakes.&nbsp; Using polygon set operations 
and polygon connectivity extraction provided by Boost.Polygon we will automate 
the identification of transistors and the tracing of connectivity.&nbsp; Based 
on this
<a href="analysis.htm">analysis</a> of Boost.Polygon performance we can expect 
this methodology to easily scale up to million gate blocks on standard 
workstations and arbitrarily large designs given sufficient system memory.&nbsp; 
let's start 
by implementing some data structures for our application.</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">struct layout_rectangle {<br>
&nbsp; int xl, yl, xh, yh;<br>
&nbsp; std::string layer;<br>
};</font></p>
<p>Our layout rectangle is nice and minimal, just enough to store its data.&nbsp; 
It is defined in <a href="tutorial/layout_rectangle.hpp">layout_rectangle.hpp</a>. Next 
let's implement the layout 
pin in a similar way.</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">struct layout_pin {<br>
&nbsp; int xl, yl, xh, yh;<br>
&nbsp; std::string layer;<br>
&nbsp; std::string net;<br>
};</font></p>
<p>Our layout pin is defined in <a href="tutorial/layout_pin.hpp">layout_pin.hpp</a>.&nbsp; Now 
let's define a layout database object and populate it from our parsed 
layout data in in <a href="tutorial/layout_database.hpp">layout_database.hpp</a>.</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">typedef std::map&lt;std::string, 
boost::polygon::polygon_90_set_data&lt;int&gt; &gt; layout_database;<br>
<br>
//map the layout rectangle data type to the boost::polygon::rectangle_concept<br>
namespace boost { namespace polygon{<br>
&nbsp; template &lt;&gt;<br>
&nbsp; struct rectangle_traits&lt;layout_rectangle&gt; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; typedef int coordinate_type;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; typedef interval_data&lt;int&gt; interval_type;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static inline interval_type get(const layout_rectangle&amp; 
rectangle, orientation_2d orient) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(orient == HORIZONTAL)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return interval_type(rectangle.xl, 
rectangle.xh);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return interval_type(rectangle.yl, rectangle.yh);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; };<br>
<br>
&nbsp; template &lt;&gt;<br>
&nbsp; struct geometry_concept&lt;layout_rectangle&gt; { typedef rectangle_concept 
type; };<br>
}}<br>
<br>
//insert layout rectangles into a layout database<br>
inline void populate_layout_database(layout_database&amp; layout, std::vector&lt;layout_rectangle&gt;&amp; 
rects) {<br>
&nbsp; for(std::size_t i = 0; i &lt; rects.size(); ++i) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; layout[rects[i].layer].insert(rects[i]);<br>
&nbsp; }<br>
}</font></p>
<p>We don't need to insert pins into the layout database because it doesn't know 
anything about connectivity, just geometry.&nbsp; However, we do need to know 
something about connectivity to compare a schematic to a layout, so we need to 
define our connectivity database and some logical objects.&nbsp; First we define 
an object for a logical device in <a href="tutorial/device.hpp">device.hpp</a>.&nbsp; 
Since we are lazy this object does double duty as a pin and both types of 
transistor.&nbsp; A traditional object oriented design might declare a base 
class with virtual destructor and derive every device from that.&nbsp; Since we 
aren't paid by the line of code let's just keep things simple.</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">struct device {<br>
&nbsp; std::string type;<br>
&nbsp; std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; terminals;<br>
};</font></p>
<p>Now let's define a schematic database object in
<a href="tutorial/schematic_database.hpp">schematic_database.hpp</a> and populate it from our parsed 
schematic data.</p>
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size="2">struct schematic_database{<br>
&nbsp; std::vector&lt;device&gt; devices;<br>
&nbsp; std::map&lt;std::string, std::set&lt;std::size_t&gt; &gt; nets;<br>
};<br>
<br>
//given a vector of devices populate the map of net name to set of device index<br>
inline void extract_netlist(std::map&lt;std::string, std::set&lt;std::size_t&gt; &gt;&amp; nets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
std::vector&lt;device&gt;&amp; devices) {<br>
&nbsp; for(std::size_t i = 0; i &lt; devices.size(); ++i) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for(std::size_t j = 0; j &lt; devices[i].terminals.size(); ++j) 
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //create association between net name and device 
id<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
nets[devices[i].terminals[j]].insert(nets[devices[i].terminals[j]].end(), i);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; }<br>
}</font></font></p>
<p>Our schematic database is just a vector of devices, which are associated to 
nets by name through their terminals and a map of net name to set of device 
index into the vector, which completes the graph by associating nets with their 
devices.&nbsp; Given the devices and their terminal nets we easily build the 
mapping from nets to devices with the extract_netlist operation.&nbsp; Now we 
are ready to start working on extracting our layout to a derived schematic 
database.&nbsp; However, first we need to build a physical connectivity database 
with geometry in it before we can build a logical connectivity database from the 
layout.&nbsp; We define a simple connectivity database in
<a href="tutorial/connectivity_database.hpp">connectivity_database.hpp</a> as a 
map of net name to layout database of geometry connected to that net and 
populate it with the layout database and pin data.</p>

<p>This populate connectivity database function is our first real use of 
Boost.Polygon in our application.&nbsp; Here we are doing Boolean (polygon set) 
operations on layout layers to merge together the PDIFF and NDIFF layers and cut 
away the GATE layer from the result, for example.&nbsp; We connect up the layout 
starting from the pins and working our way down the layer stack to the 
transistor level.&nbsp; It would work equally well to work our way up the layer 
stack, or connect things up in any order, really, but this way produces fewer 
internal temporary nets that need to be merged when connections between them are 
discovered later.&nbsp; The connect layout to layer function used above needs to 
be implemented before we can populate our connectivity database.</p>

<p>The connect layout to layer function uses the connectivity extraction feature 
of Boost.Polyon to build a connectivity graph for polygons on the input polygon 
set and in the connectivity database on the specified layer.&nbsp; It then finds 
polygons associated with existing nets in the connectivity database through 
graph traversal and inserts them into the connectivity database.&nbsp; Finally, 
polygons that weren't connected to existing nets are inserted into the 
connectivity database on auto-generated internal net names.&nbsp; The insertion 
of a connected component into the connectivity database is handled by the 
recursive traversal of the connectivity graph that we implement next.</p>

</font>We want to merge internally generated nets into pin nets, which is the 
most complicated part of this simple procedure.&nbsp; Now that we have our 
connectivity database extracted from pins down to transistors we need to extract 
our transistors and establish the relationship between transistor terminals and

<p>We append transistors onto the vector of devices with their terminals 
populated with net names extracted from the connectivity database.&nbsp; 
Transistors' terminals are connected through the POLY and DIFF layers where DIFF 
contains both PDIFF and NDIFF.&nbsp; The connection to POLY layer is the gate of 
the transistor while the connections to DIFF on either side of the channel of 
the transistor are the source and drain.&nbsp; We can use this to extract are p 
and n-type transistors. <font size="2" face="Courier New"><br>

<p>The extract devices procedure makes some more use of Boost.Polygon Boolean 
operations on the layout data when we exclude GATE material over NDIFF that 
isn't also over NWELL to extract our n-type transistors.&nbsp; We also are using 
the &quot;interact&quot; operation on polygon gets, which is implemented in terms of 
connectivity extraction and retains all polygons of a polygon set that touch or 
overlap polygons from another polygon set.&nbsp; Now that we have a vector of 
devices we can build a schematic database by calling the extract_netlist 
function.&nbsp; We can then compare the extracted schematic from the schematic 
read in from file with the functions defined in
<a href="tutorial/compare_schematics.hpp">compare_schematics.hpp</a>.&nbsp; 
Since comparing two schematics has no geometric aspect we won't go into that 
procedure here in the tutorial and will skip to the integration of all these 
procedures in defined in <a href="tutorial/extract.cpp">extract.cpp</a> to build 
the layout to schematic comparison algorithm.</p>

<p>This concludes our tutorial on how to build a simple layout to schematic 
verification application based on Boost.Polygon library capabilities.&nbsp; The 
implementation of this application made many simplifying assumptions that are 
not valid in the real world and hard coded a lot of things that need to be 
configurable in a real layout verification application.&nbsp; However, it does 
give an idea of how to use Boost.Polygon to solve real problems and points in 
the direction of how a real application might use Boost.Polygon.</p>
