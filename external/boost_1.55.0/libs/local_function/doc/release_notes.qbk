[section Release Notes]

This section lists the major changes between different library releases (in chronological order).

[heading Version 1.0.0 (2012-04-12)]

# Incorporated all comments from the [@http://lists.boost.org/boost-announce/2011/12/0340.php Boost review of this library].
# Removed local blocks and local exits.
# Renamed the library from Boost.Local to Boost.LocalFunction.
# Using `this_` instead of `this` also in the local function declaration (not just the body).
# Made changes that allow to return local functions (similar to closures).
# Added GCC lambda and constant block examples.
# Moved `overloaded_function` to Boost.Functional/OverloadedFunction.
# Moved `BOOST_IDENTITY_TYPE` to Boost.Utility/IdentityType.
# Completely removed use of Boost.Typeof when bound and result types are explicitly specified.
# Added `..._ID` macros for multiple expansions on the same line.
# Fixed compilation on Boost regression test platforms.

[heading Version 0.2.0 (2011-05-14)]

# Replaced parenthesized syntax with variadic and sequencing macro syntaxes.
# Profiled library performances against other approaches.
# Replaced virtual functor trick with casting functor trick (for smaller run-time).
# Optimized library run-time (rearranging code and not using casting functor trick on compilers that accept local classes as template parameters).
# Supported inline and recursive local functions.
# Added type-of macro to expose bound types.
# Allowed to explicitly specify bound types.
# Removed using `boost::function` instead of exposing internal local functor as public API.
# Added functor to overload local functions (and functors in general).
# Implemented support for nesting local functions, blocks, and exits into one another.

[heading Version 0.1.1 (2011-01-10)]

# Uploaded library source into Boost SVN sandbox.
# Fixed prev/next arrows and other minor layouts in documentation.
# Added Release section to documentation.

[heading Version 0.1.0 (2011-01-03)]

# Shared with Boost for first round of comments.

[heading Version 0.0.1 (2010-12-15)]
