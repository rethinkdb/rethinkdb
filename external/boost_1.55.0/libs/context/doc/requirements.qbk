[section:requirements Requirements]

__boost_context__ must be built for the particular compiler(s) and CPU
architecture(s)s being targeted. __boost_context__ includes assembly code and,
therefore, requires GNU AS for supported POSIX systems, MASM for Windows/x86
systems and ARMasm for Windows/arm systems.

[note MASM64 (ml64.exe) is a part of Microsoft's Windows Driver Kit.]

[important Please note that `address-model=64` must be given to bjam command line
on 64bit Windows for 64bit build; otherwise 32bit code will be generated.]

[important For cross-compiling the lib you must specify certain additional
properties at bjam command line: `target-os`, `abi`, `binary-format`,
`architecture` and `address-model`.]
