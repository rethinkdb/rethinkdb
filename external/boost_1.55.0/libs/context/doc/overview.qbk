[section:overview Overview]

__boost_context__ is a foundational library that provides a sort of cooperative
multitasking on a single thread. By providing an abstraction of the current
execution state in the current thread, including the stack (with local
variables) and stack pointer, all registers and CPU flags, and the instruction
pointer, a __fcontext__ instance represents a specific point in the application's
execution path. This is useful for building higher-level abstractions, like
__coroutines__, __coop_threads__ or an equivalent to
[@http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9k7k7cf0%28v=vs.80%29.aspx C# keyword __yield__]
in C++.

A __fcontext__ provides the means to suspend the current execution path and to
transfer execution control, thereby permitting another __fcontext__ to run on the
current thread. This state full transfer mechanism enables a __fcontext__ to
suspend execution from within nested functions and, later, to resume from where
it was suspended. While the execution path represented by a __fcontext__ only
runs on a single thread, it can be migrated to another thread at any given time.

A context switch between threads requires system calls (involving the OS
kernel), which can cost more than thousand CPU cycles on x86 CPUs. By contrast,
transferring control among them requires only fewer than hundred CPU cycles because
it does not involve system calls as it is done within a single thread.

In order to use the classes and functions described here, you can either include
the specific headers specified by the descriptions of each class or function, or
include the master library header:

    #include <boost/context/all.hpp>

which includes all the other headers in turn.

All functions and classes are contained in the namespace __context_ns__.
