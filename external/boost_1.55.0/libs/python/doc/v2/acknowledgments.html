    <p><a href="http://www.boost.org/people/dave_abrahams.htm">Dave Abrahams</a> is
    the architect, designer, and implementor of <b>Boost.Python</b>.</p>

    <p><a href="mailto:brett.calcott@paradise.net.nz">Brett Calcott</a>
    contributed and maintains the Visual Studio project files and
    documentation.</p>

    <p><a href="mailto:Gottfried.Ganssauge-at-haufe.de">Gottfried
    Ganﬂauge</a> supplied support for opaque pointer conversions,
    complete with documentation and a regression test (and I didn't
    even have to ask him for those)!

    <p>Joel de Guzman implemented the <a href="overloads.html">default
    argument support</a> and wrote the excellent <a href=
    "../tutorial/index.html">tutorial documentation</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.boost.org/people/ralf_w_grosse_kunstleve.htm">Ralf W.
    Grosse-Kunstleve</a> implemented the <a href="pickle.html">pickle
    support</a>, and has enthusiastically supported the library since its
    birth, contributing to design decisions and providing invaluable
    real-world insight into user requirements. Ralf has written some <a href=
    "faq.html#question2">extensions</a> for converting C++ containers that I
    hope will be incorporated into the library soon. He also implemented the
    cross-module support in the first version of Boost.Python. More
    importantly, Ralf makes sure nobody forgets the near-perfect synergy of
    C++ and Python for solving the problems of large-scale software
    construction.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.boost.org/people/aleksey_gurtovoy.htm">Aleksey Gurtovoy</a>
    wrote an incredible C++ <a href="http://www.mywikinet.com/mpl">Template
    Metaprogramming Library</a> which allows Boost.Python to perform much of
    its compile-time magic. In addition, Aleksey very generously contributed
    his time and deep knowledge of the quirks of various buggy compilers to
    help us get around problems at crucial moments.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.boost.org/people/paul_mensonides.htm">Paul Mensonides</a>,
    building on the work <a href="http://www.boost.org/people/vesa_karvonen.htm">Vesa
    Karvonen</a>, wrote a similarly amazing <a href=
    "../../../preprocessor/doc/index.html">Preprocessor Metaprogramming
    Library</a>, and generously contributed the time and expertise to get it
    working in the Boost.Python library, rewriting much of Boost.Python to
    use the new preproccessor metaprogramming constructs and helping us to
    work around buggy and slow C++ preprocessors.</p>

    <p><a href="mailto:nicodemus-at-globalite.com.br">Bruno da Silva de
    Oliveira</a> contributed the ingenious <a
    href="../../pyste/index.html">Pyste</a> (&quot;Pie-Steh&quot;)
    code generator.

    <p><a href="mailto:nickm@sitius.com">Nikolay Mladenov</a> contributed
    <code>staticmethod</code> support.</p>

    <p>Martin Casado solved some sticky problems which allow us to build the
    Boost.Python shared library for AIX's crazy dynamic linking model.</p>

    <p><a href="mailto:achim@procoders.net">Achim Domma</a> contributed some
    of the <a href="reference.html#object_wrappers">Object Wrappers</a> and
    HTML templates for this documentation. Dave Hawkes contributed
    inspiration for the use of the <code><a href=
    "scope.html#scope-spec">scope</a></code> class to simplify module
    definition syntax. Pearu Pearson wrote some of the test cases that are in
    the current test suite.</p>

    <p>The development of this version of Boost.Python was funded in part by
    the <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore National
    Laboratories</a> and by the <a href="http://cci.lbl.gov/">Computational
    Crystallography Initiative</a> at Lawrence Berkeley National
    Laboratories.</p>

    <p><a href="http://kogs-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~koethe/">Ullrich
    Koethe</a> had independently developed a similar system. When he
    discovered Boost.Python v1, he generously contributed countless hours of
    coding and much insight into improving it. He is responsible for an early
    version of the support for function overloading and wrote the support for
    reflecting C++ inheritance relationships. He has helped to improve
    error-reporting from both Python and C++ (we hope to do as well in v2
    again soon), and has designed the original support for exposing numeric
    operators, including a way to avoid explicit coercion by means of
    overloading.</p>

    <p>The members of the boost mailing list and the Python community
    supplied invaluable early feedback. In particular, Ron Clarke, Mark
    Evans, Anton Gluck, Chuck Ingold, Prabhu Ramachandran, and Barry Scott
    took the brave step of trying to use Boost.Python while it was still in
    early stages of development.</p>

    <p>The first version of Boost.Python would not have been possible without
    the support of Dragon Systems, which supported its development and
    release as a Boost library.</p>
