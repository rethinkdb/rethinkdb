  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This is a partial list of projects using Boost.Python. If you are using
  Boost.Python as your Python/C++ binding solution, we'd be proud to list
  your project on this page. Just <a href=
  "mailto:c++-sig@python.org">post</a> a short description of your project
  and how Boost.Python helps you get the job done, and we'll add it to this
  page .</p>

  <h3>Data Analysis</h3>

  <dl class="page-index">
    <dt><b><a href="http://www.neuralynx.com">NeuraLab</a></b></dt>

    <dd>Neuralab is a data analysis environment specifically tailored for
    neural data from <a href="http://www.neuralynx.com">Neuralynx</a>
    acquisition systems. Neuralab combines presentation quality graphics, a
    numerical analysis library, and the <a href=
    "http://www.python.org">Python</a> scripting engine in a single
    application. With Neuralab, Neuralynx users can perform common analysis
    tasks with just a few mouse clicks. More advanced users can create custom
    Python scripts, which can optionally be assigned to menus and mouse
    clicks.</dd>

  <dl class="page-index">
    <dt><b>TSLib</b> - <a href="http://www.fortressinv.com">Fortress
    Investment Group LLC</a></dt>

    <dd>
      Fortress Investment Group has contracted <a href=
      "http://www.boost-consulting.com">Boost Consulting</a> to develop core
      internal financial analysis tools in C++ and to prepare Python bindings
      for them using Boost.Python.

      <p>Tom Barket of Fortress writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
        We have a large C++ analytical library specialized for research in
        finance and economics, built for speed and mission critical
        stability. Yet Python offers us the flexibility to test out new ideas
        quickly and increase the productivity of our time versus working in
        C++. There are several key features which make Python stand out. Its
        elegance, stability, and breadth of resources on the web are all
        valuable, but the most important is its extensibility, due to its
        open source transparency. Boost.Python makes Python extensibility
        extremely simple and straightforward, yet preserves a great deal of
        power and control.

      <p>KDE Interactive Geometry is a high-school level educational tool,

      geometrical constructions. It is meant to be the most intuitive, yet
      featureful application of its kind.</p>

      <p>Versions after 0.6.x (will) support objects built by the user
      himself in the Python language. The exporting of the relevant internal
      API's were done using Boost.Python, which made the process very

        perform one off tasks without having to go through the full
        compilation cycle.

    million copies, Sid Meier's Civilization IV is a bold step forward for
    the franchise, with spectacular new 3D graphics and all-new single and
    multiplayer content. Civilization IV will also set a new standard for
    user-modification, allowing gamers to create their own add-ons using
    Python and XML.

    <p>Sid Meier's Civilization IV will be released for PC in late 2005. For

  <p>Boost.Python is used as the interface layer between the C++ game code
  and Python. Python is used for many purposes in the game, including map
  generation, interface screens, game events, tools, tutorials, etc. Most
  high-level game operations have been exposed to Python in order to give
  modders the power they need to customize the game.</p>

      native python classes when designing missions or writing AI's.</p>

        scripting/interaction level, but also for rapid prototyping, since
        the underlying C++ class library is pretty much fully exposed via
        boost.python (at least the high-level interface). The combined power
        of C++ and Python for this project turned out to be just awesome.

    <dd>
      Computational Crystallography is concerned with the derivation of
      atomic models of crystal structures, given experimental X-ray
      diffraction data. The cctbx is an open-source library of fundamental
      algorithms for crystallographic computations. The core algorithms are
      implemented in C++ and accessed through higher-level Python interfaces.

      <p>The cctbx grew together with Boost.Python and is designed from the
      ground up as a hybrid Python/C++ system. With one minor exception,
      run-time polymorphism is completely handled by Python. C++ compile-time
      polymorphism is used to implement performance critical algorithms. The
      Python and C++ layers are seamlessly integrated using Boost.Python.</p>

      <p>The SourceForge cctbx project is organized in modules to facilitate
      use in non-crystallographic applications. The scitbx module implements
      a general purpose array family for scientific applications and pure C++
      ports of FFTPACK and the L-BFGS quasi-Newton minimizer.</p>

        rings and subsets of the powerset of the Boolean variables. As
        a unique approach, binary decision diagrams are used as
        internal storage type for polynomial structures. On top of
