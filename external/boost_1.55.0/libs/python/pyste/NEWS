25 April 2005
- Fixed bug where the code for wrappers of member functions were defined outside 
the pyste namespace. Reported by Dan Haffey.

9 October 2004
- Applied a patch by Christian Hudon that fixed an issue with files
that had a tail and relative includes.

18 July 2004
- Applied a patch by Paul Bridger that solves some problems for wrapper 
methods.
- Applied a patch by Baptiste Lepilleur that allows the user to inject
code inside the class definition.
- Applied another patch by Baptiste Lepilleur that inserts two new command-line
options that helps with writing makefiles.

27 May 2004
Applied patch by Paul Bridger that solves a problem on windows regarding 
spaces on paths. Thanks Paul!

Applied another patch that fixes the module name if pyste is run from
another directory of where the .pyste file is located. Patch contributted 
by Paul Bridger.

17 May 2004
Applied a patch by Roman Yakovenko that makes the export of unnamed enums
better. Thanks Roman!

23 October 2003
Fixed bug where a class would appear more than one in the generated code.

6 October 2003
Fixed bug reported by Niall Douglas (using his patch) about UniqueInt not
appearing correctly with --multiple.

Added precompiled header support on windows systems (using #pragma hdrstop).
Suggested by Niall Douglas.

Fixed a bug with -I directive and AllFromHeader. Reported by Scott Snyder.

4 October 2003
Added return_self, thanks for Niall Douglas for pointing out that it was
missing.

Added --file-list, where you can pass a file where the pyste files are listed
one per line. Also suggested by Niall Douglas.

Documentation has been finally updated, after a long wait. Please let me know
if you spot any mistake!

2 October 2003
Scott Snyder found a typo in ClassExporter that prevented -= and *= operators
from being exported. Thanks Scott!

20 September 2003
Added return_by_value in the list of policies supported. Thanks to Niall
Douglas for the remainder.

19 September 2003
Better support for unnamed enums, plus they are by default exported to the
parent's namespace. Normal enums can have the same behaviour using the function
export_values on the Enum object. Feature requested by Niall Douglas.

10 September 2003
A new variable is accessible in the Pyste files: INTERFACE_FILE contains the 
full path of the pyste file.

4 September 2003
Now it is possible to override protected and private pure virtual functions
in Python, as requested by Roman Yakovenko.

23 August 2003
Fixed bug where some Imports where not writing their include files.  
Now whenever the declarations change, the cache files are rebuilt
automatically.

19 August 2003
Fixed a bug related to the generation of the bases<> template.

17 August 2003
Added support for insertion of user code in the generated code.

16 August 2003
Applied a patch by Gottfried Ganssauge that adds exception specifiers to 
wrapper functions and pointer declarations. Thanks a lot Gottfried!!

Applied a patch by Prabhu Ramachandran that fixes ae problem with the 
pure virtual method generation. Thanks again Prabhu!

10 August 2003
Support for incremental generation of the code has been added. This changes
how --multiple works; documentation of this new feature will follow. Thanks
to Prabhu Ramachandran, that saw the need for this feature and discussed a
solution. 

Automatically convert \ to / in Windows systems before passing the paths to
gccxml.

Fixed a bug reported by Prabhu Ramachandran, where in some classes the virtual
methods were being definied incorrectly. Thanks a lot Prabhu!

7 July 2003
Applied 2 patches by Prabhu Ramachandran: a fix in the new --multiple method,
and two new functions "hold_with_shared_ptr" and its counterpart for auto_ptr.
Thanks a lot Prabhu!

Fixed a bug where the macro BOOST_PYTHON_OPAQUE_SPECIALIZED_TYPE_ID was being
called multiple times for the same type.
Thanks to Gottfried Ganﬂauge for reporting this!

Fixed bug where using AllFromHeader didn't use bases<> when exporting 
hierarchies.

Fixed the staticmethod bug.

5 July 2003
Changed how --multiple works: now it generates one cpp file for each pyste
file, makeing easier to integrate Pyste with build systems.

4 July 2003
Applied patch that solved a bug in ClassExporter and added a distutils install
script (install/setup.py), both contributed by Prabhu Ramachandran.
Thanks Prabhu!

2 July 2003
Jim Wilson found a bug where types like "char**" were being interpreted as 
"char*". Thanks Jim!

16 June 2003
Thanks to discussions with David Abrahams and Roman Sulzhyk, some behaviours
have changed:

- If you export a derived class without exporting its base classes, the derived
  class will explicitly export the bases's methods and attributes. Before, if
  you were interested in the bases's methods, you had to export the base
  classes too.

- Added a new function, no_override. When a member function is specified as
  "no_override", no virtual wrappers are generated for it, improving
  performance and letting the code more clean.

- There was a bug in which the policy of virtual member functions was being
  ignored (patch by Roman Sulzhyk). 
  
Thanks again to Roman Sulzhyk for the patches and discussion in the c++-sig.

4 June 2003
Major improvements in memory usage.

3 June 2003
Appliced a patch from Giulio Eulisse that allows unnamed enumerations to be
exported with an AllFromHeader construct. Thanks a lot Giulio!

2 June 2003
Added a new construct, add_method. See documentation.

23 May 2003
Support for global variables added.
Various bug fixes.

08 May 2003
Fixed bug where in a certain cases the GCCXMLParser would end up with multiple
declarations of the same class

22 Apr 2003
- Now shows a warning when the user tries to export a forward-declared class.
  Forward-declared classes are ignored by the AllFromHeader construct.
- Fixed a bug where classes, functions and enums where being exported, even if
  excluded from a AllFromHeader construct.

16 Apr 2003
Added a more generic (but ugly) code to declare the smart pointer converters.

07 Apr 2003
- Removed the warnings about forward declarations: it was not accurate enough.
  Another strategy must be thought of.
- Fixed bug in the --multiple mode, where the order of the class instantiations
  could end up wrong.
- Lots of fixes in the documentation, pointed out by Dirk Gerrits. Thanks Dirk!
- Fixed support for the return_opaque_pointer policy (the support macro was not
  being declared).


06 Apr 2003
Support for the improved static data members support of Boost.Python.

05 Apr 2003
New option for generating the bindings: --multiple.

02 Apr 2003
Forward declarations are now detected and a warning is generated.

24 Mar 2003
Default policy for functions/methods that return const T& is now
return_value_policy<copy_const_reference>().

22 Mar 2003
Exporting virtual methods of the base classes in the derived classes too.

21 Mar 2003
Added manual support for boost::shared_ptr and std::auto_ptr (see doc).

19 Mar 2003 
Added support for int, double, float and long operators acting as expected in
python.

14 Mar 2003 
Fixed bug: Wrappers for protected and virtual methods were not being generated.
