This library is based on the design by Peter Dimov. During the initial
development
Joaquín M López Muñoz made many useful suggestions and contributed fixes.

The formal review was managed by Thorsten Ottosen, and the library reviewed by:
David Abrahams, Alberto Barbati, Topher Cooper, Caleb Epstein, Dave Harris,
Chris Jefferson, Bronek Kozicki, John Maddock, Tobias Swinger, Jaap Suter,
Rob Stewart and Pavel Vozenilek. Since then, further constructive criticism has
been made by Daniel Krügler, Alexander Nasonov and 沈慧峰.

The implementation of the hash function for pointers is based on suggestions
made by Alberto Barbati and Dave Harris. Dave Harris also suggested an
important improvement to [funcref boost::hash_combine] that was taken up.

Some useful improvements to the floating point hash algorithm were suggested
by Daniel Krügler.

The original implementation came from Jeremy B. Maitin-Shepard's hash table
library, although this is a complete rewrite.
