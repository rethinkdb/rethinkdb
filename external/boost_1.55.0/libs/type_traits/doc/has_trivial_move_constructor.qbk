[section:has_trivial_move_constructor has_trivial_move_constructor]

   template <class T>
   struct has_trivial_move_constructor : public __tof {};
  
__inherit If T is a (possibly cv-qualified) type with a trivial move-constructor
then inherits from __true_type, otherwise inherits from __false_type.

If a type has a trivial move-constructor then the constructor has the same effect
as copying the bits of one object to the other: 
calls to the constructor can be safely replaced with a call to `memcpy`.

__compat If the compiler does not support partial-specialization of class 
templates, then this template can not be used with function types.

Without some (as yet unspecified) help from the compiler, 
has_trivial_move_constructor will never report that a user-defined class or struct has a 
trivial constructor; this is always safe, if possibly sub-optimal.  
Currently (February 2013) compilers have no necessary __intrinsics to ensure that this 
trait "just works".  You may also test to see if the necessary __intrinsics are available 
by checking to see if the macro `BOOST_HAS_TRIVIAL_MOVE_CONSTRUCTOR` is defined.

__examples

[:`has_trivial_move_constructor<int>` inherits from `__true_type`.]

[:`has_trivial_move_constructor<char*>::type` is the type `__true_type`.]

[:`has_trivial_move_constructor<int (*)(long)>::value` is an integral constant 
expression that evaluates to /true/.]

[:`has_trivial_move_constructor<MyClass>::value` is an integral constant 
expression that evaluates to /false/.]

[:`has_trivial_move_constructor<T>::value_type` is the type `bool`.]
