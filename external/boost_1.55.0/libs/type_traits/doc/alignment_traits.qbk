[section:alignment Synthesizing Types with Specific Alignments]

Some low level memory management routines need to synthesize a POD type with
specific alignment properties.  The template `__type_with_alignment` finds the smallest
type with a specified alignment, while template `__aligned_storage` creates a type 
with a specific size and alignment.

[*Synopsis]

   template <std::size_t Align>
   struct __type_with_alignment;
   
   template <std::size_t Size, std::size_t Align>
   struct __aligned_storage;
