* [*Returns:] A range adapted to return both the element and the associated index. The returned range consists of iterators that have in addition to the usual iterator member functions an `index()` member function that returns the appropriate index for the element in the sequence corresponding with the iterator.
* [*Range Category:] __single_pass_range__
* [*Range Return Type:] `boost::indexed_range<typeof(rng)>`
* [*Returned Range Category:] The range category of `rng`

This would produce the output:
``
Element = 10 Index = 0
Element = 20 Index = 1
Element = 30 Index = 2
Element = 40 Index = 3
Element = 50 Index = 4
Element = 60 Index = 5
Element = 70 Index = 6
Element = 80 Index = 7
Element = 90 Index = 8
