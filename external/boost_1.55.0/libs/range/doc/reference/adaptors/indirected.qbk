* [*Precondition:] The `value_type` of the range defines unary `operator*()`
* [*Postcondition:] For all elements `x` in the returned range, `x` is the result of `*y` where `y` is the corresponding element in the original range.
* [*Range Category:] __single_pass_range__
* [*Range Return Type:] `boost::indirected_range<typeof(rng)>`
* [*Returned Range Category:] The range category of `rng`
