[section:remove_erase_if remove_erase_if]

[heading Prototype]

``
template<class Container, class Pred>
Container& remove_erase_if(Container& target,
                           Pred pred);
``

[heading Description]

`remove_erase_if` removes the elements `x` that satisfy `pred(x)` from the container.
This is in contrast to the `erase` algorithm which merely rearranges elements.

[heading Definition]

Defined in the header file `boost/range/algorithm_ext/erase.hpp`

[heading Requirements]

# `Container` supports erase of an iterator range.
# `Pred` is a model of the `Predicate` Concept.

[heading Complexity]

Linear. Proportional to `distance(target)`s.
