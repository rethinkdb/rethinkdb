[section:remove_erase remove_erase]

[heading Prototype]

``
template<class Container, class Value>
Container& remove_erase(Container& target,
                        const Value& value);
``

[heading Description]

`remove_erase` actually eliminates the elements equal to `value` from the container. This
is in contrast to the `remove` algorithm which merely rearranges elements.

[heading Definition]

Defined in the header file `boost/range/algorithm_ext/erase.hpp`

[heading Requirements]

# `Container` supports erase of an iterator range.

[heading Complexity]

Linear. Proportional to `distance(target)`s.
