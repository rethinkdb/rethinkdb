[section:iota iota]

[heading Prototype]

``
template<class ForwardRange, class Value>
ForwardRange& iota(ForwardRange& rng, Value x);
``

[heading Description]

`iota` traverses forward through `rng`, each element `y` in `rng` is assigned a value equivalent
to `x + boost::distance(boost::begin(rng), it)`

[heading Definition]

Defined in the header file `boost/range/algorithm_ext/iota.hpp`

[heading Requirements]

# `ForwardRange` is a model of the __forward_range__ Concept.
# `Value` is a model of the `Incrementable` Concept.

[heading Complexity]

Linear. Exactly `distance(rng)` assignments into `rng`.
