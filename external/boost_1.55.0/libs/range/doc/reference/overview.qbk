[section:overview Overview]

Three types of objects are currently supported by the library:

* standard-like containers
* `std::pair<iterator,iterator>`
* built-in arrays

Even though the behavior of the primary templates are exactly such that standard containers will be supported by default, the requirements are much lower than the standard container requirements. For example, the utility class __iterator_range__ implements the __minimal_interface__ required to make the class a __forward_range__.

Please also see __range_concepts__ for more details.
