[heading Prototype]

``
template<class ForwardRange, class Outputiterator, class Value>
OutputIterator
remove_copy(ForwardRange& rng, OutputIterator out, const Value& val);

template<class ForwardRange, class OutputIterator, class Value>
OutputIterator
remove_copy(const ForwardRange& rng, OutputIterator out, const Value& val);
``

[heading Description]

`remove_copy` copied all of the elements `x` from `rng` for which `x == val` is `false`.

[heading Definition]

Defined in the header file `boost/range/algorithm/remove_copy.hpp`

[heading Requirements]

* `ForwardRange` is a model of the __forward_range__ Concept.
* `ForwardRange` is mutable.
* `Value` is a model of the `EqualityComparableConcept`.
* Objects of type `Value` can be compared for equality with objects of `ForwardRange`'s value type.

[heading Complexity]

Linear. `remove_copy` performs exactly `distance(rng)` comparisons for equality.
