[heading Description]

The versions of `find_end` that return an iterator, return an iterator to the beginning of the last sub-sequence equal to `rng2` within `rng1`.
Equality is determined by `operator==` for non-predicate versions of `find_end`, and by satisfying `pred` in the predicate versions. The versions of `find_end` that return a `range_return`, defines `found` in the same manner as the returned iterator described above.

[heading Definition]

Defined in the header file `boost/range/algorithm/find_end.hpp`

[heading Requirements]

[*For the non-predicate versions:]

* `ForwardRange1` is a model of the __forward_range__ Concept.
* `ForwardRange2` is a model of the __forward_range__ Concept.
* `ForwardRange1`'s value type is a model of the `EqualityComparableConcept`.
* `ForwardRange2`'s value type is a model of the `EqualityComparableConcept`.
* Objects of `ForwardRange1`'s value type can be compared for equality with objects of `ForwardRange2`'s value type.

[*For the predicate versions:]

* `ForwardRange1` is a model of the __forward_range__ Concept.
* `ForwardRange2` is a model of the __forward_range__ Concept.
* `BinaryPredicate` is a model of the `BinaryPredicateConcept`.
* `ForwardRange1`'s value type is convertible to `BinaryPredicate`'s first argument type.
* `ForwardRange2`'s value type is convertible to `BinaryPredicate`'s second argument type.

[heading Complexity]

The number of comparisons is proportional to `distance(rng1) * distance(rng2)`. If both `ForwardRange1` and `ForwardRange2` are models of `BidirectionalRangeConcept` then the average complexity is linear and the worst case is `distance(rng1) * distance(rng2)`.
