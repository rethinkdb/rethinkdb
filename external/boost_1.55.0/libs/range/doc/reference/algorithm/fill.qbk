[heading Prototype]

``
template<class ForwardRange, class Value>
ForwardRange& fill( ForwardRange& rng, const Value& val );
``

[heading Description]

`fill` assigns the value `val` to every element in the range `rng`.

[heading Definition]

Defined in the header file `boost/range/algorithm/fill.hpp`

[heading Requirements]

* `ForwardRange` is a model of the __forward_range__ Concept.
* `ForwardRange` is mutable.
* `Value` is a model of the `AssignableConcept`.
* `Value` is convertible to `ForwardRange`'s value type.

[heading Complexity]
