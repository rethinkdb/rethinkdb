[heading Compatibility]
Property tree uses partial class template specialization. There has been no
attempt to work around lack of support for this. The library will therefore
most probably not work with Visual C++ 7.0 or earlier, or gcc 2.x.

Property tree has been tested (regressions successfully compiled and run)
with the following compilers:

* Visual C++ 8.0
* gcc 3.4.2 (MinGW)
* gcc 3.3.5 (Linux)
* gcc 3.4.4 (Linux)
* gcc 4.3.3 (Linux)
* Intel C++ 9.0 (Linux)

[heading Rationale]
# [*Why are there 3 versions of __ptree_get__? Couldn't there be just one?]
The three versions reflect experience gathered during several of years of using
property tree in several different applications. During that time I tried hard
to come up with one, proper form of the get function, and failed. I know of
these three basic patterns of usage:

 * ['Just get the data and I do not care if it cannot be done.]  This is used
   when the programmer is fairly sure that data exists. Or in homework
   assignments. Or when tomorrow is final deadline for your project.
 * ['Get the data and revert to default value if it cannot be done.]  Used when
   you want to allow omitting the key in question. Implemented by some similar
   tools (windows INI file access functions).
 * ['Get the data, but I care more whether you succeeded than I do for the data
   itself.] Used when you want to vary control flow depending on get
   success/failure. Or to check for presence of a key.

[heading Future Development]
* More parsers:  YAML, environment strings.
* More robust XML parser.
* Mathematical relations:  ptree difference, union, intersection.
  Useful for finding configuration file changes etc.
