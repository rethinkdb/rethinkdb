The central component of the library is the __basic_ptree__ class template.
Instances of this class are property trees. It is parametrized on key and data
type, and key comparison policy; __ptree__, __wptree__, __iptree__ and
__wiptree__ are typedefs of __basic_ptree__ using predefined combinations of
template parameters.  Property tree is basically a somewhat simplified standard
container (the closest being std::list), plus a bunch of extra member
functions. These functions allow easy and effective access to the data stored
in property tree. They are various variants of __ptree_get__, __ptree_put__,
__ptree_get_value__, __ptree_put_value__, __ptree_get_child__,
__ptree_put_child__. Additionally, there is a __ptree_data__ function to access
node data directly.

See the [classref boost::property_tree::basic_ptree basic_ptree class template synopsis] for more information.
