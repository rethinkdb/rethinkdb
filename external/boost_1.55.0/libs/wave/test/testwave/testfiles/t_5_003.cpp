// Tests the handling of comments.

#define STR(x) #x

// 3.1: A comment is converted to one space.
//R #line 22 "t_5_003.cpp"
STR(abc/* comment */de)       //R "abc de" 
abc/* comment */de            //R abc de 

// 3.2: // is not a comment of C.
// Wave always treats the '//' style as comments (even in C99 mode)
/*  assert( strcmp( str( //), "//") == 0);  */

// 3.3: Comments are parsed prior to the parsing of preprocessing directives.
