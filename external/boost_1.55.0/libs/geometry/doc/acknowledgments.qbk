[section Acknowledgments]

We like to thank all the people who helped to develop this library.

First of all we are grateful to Hartmut Kaiser for managing the formal review 
of this library. Hartmut is an excellent review manager, who intervented when 
necessary and produced the review report quickly.

We thank the 14 reviewers of our library, reviewed from November 5, 2009 to 
November 22, 2009. Reviews have been written by: Brandon Kohn, Christophe 
Henry, Fabio Fracassi, Gordon Woodhull, Joachim Faulhaber, Jonathan Franklin, 
Jose, Lucanus Simonson, Michael Caisse, Michael Fawcett, Paul Bristow, Phil 
Endecott, Thomas Klimpel, Tom Brinkman.

We also thank all people who discussed on the mailing lists (either at boost, 
or at osgeo) about __boost_geometry__, in preview stage, or in review stage, 
or after that.

Furthermore we are thankful to people supplying patches: Arnold Metselaar, 
Aleksey Tulinov, Christophe Henry

Finally I (Barend) would like to thank my former employer, Geodan. They 
allowed me to start a geographic library in 1995, which after a number of 
incarnations, redesigns, refactorings, previews, a review and even more 
refactorings have led to the now released __boost_geometry__. And with them I 
want to thank the team initially involved in developing the library, Valik 
Solorzano Barboza, Maarten Hilferink, Anne Blankert, and later Sjoerd 
Schreuder, Steven Fruijtier, Paul den Dulk, and Joris Sierman.
