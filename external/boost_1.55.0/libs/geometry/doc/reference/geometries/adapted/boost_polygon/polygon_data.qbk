[section:polygon_data Boost.Polygon's polygon_data]

Boost.Polygon's polygon type (boost::polygon::polygon_data) is adapted to the Boost.Geometry Ring Concept.

[heading Description]

Boost.Polygon's points (as well as polygons) can be used by Boost.Geometry. The
two libraries can therefore be used together. Using a boost::polygon::point_data<...>,
algorithms from both Boost.Polygon and Boost.Geometry can be called.
