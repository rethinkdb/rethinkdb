[section:boost_tuple Boost.Tuple]

Boost.Tuple tuples with arithmetic elements can be used as 
points within Boost.Geometry

[heading Description]

Boost.Tuple fixed sized collections, such as boost::tuple<double, double>, are 
(optionally) adapted to the Boost.Geometry point concept.

Boost.Tuple pairs or triples might have mutually different types, such as a 
boost::tuple<float, double>. Boost.Geometry reports the first type as its 
[link geometry.reference.core.coordinate_type coordinate_type].

Boost.Geometry supports Boost.Tuple pairs, triples, quadruples, etc up to
tuples with 10 elements (though most algorithms do not support so many 
dimensions).

A tuple can be the point type used by the models linestring, polygon, segment, 
box, and ring
