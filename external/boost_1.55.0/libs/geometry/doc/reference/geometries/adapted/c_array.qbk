[section:c_array C array]

C arrays are adapted to the Boost.Geometry point concept

[heading Description]

C arrays, such as double[2] or int[3], are (optionally) adapted to the Boost.Geometry 
point concept. They can therefore be used in many Boost.Geometry algorithms.

Note that a C array cannot be the point type of a linestring or a polygon. The reason
for that is that a std::vector does not allow containing C arrays 
(this is not related to Boost.Geometry). The C array is therefore limited to 
the point type.
