[[Case] [Behavior] ]
[[__point__, __box__, __segment__][Compiles, but no action]]
[[__linestring__][Appends point or range to the end of the linestring]]
[[__ring__][Appends point or range to the end of the ring (without explicitly closing it)]]
[[__polygon__][Appends point or range to the end of the polygon (without explicitly closing it), 
	either the exterior ring (the default) or specify a zero-based index for one of the interior rings. 
	In the last case, the interior rings are not resized automatically, 
	so ensure that the zero-based index is smaller than the number of interior rings]]
