[heading_conformance_ogc __this_function__..Within]
[note OGC defines within as completely within and not on the border. See the notes for within / on the border]

[include generated/within_status.qbk]
[note In this status matrix above: columns are types of first parameter
  and rows are types of second parameter. So a point can be checked to be 
  within a polygon, but not vice versa.]
  
[heading Notes]
If a point is located exactly on the border of a geometry, the result depends on the strategy.
The default strategy ([link geometry.reference.strategies.strategy_within_winding Winding (coordinate system agnostic)]) 
returns false in that case.

If a polygon has a reverse oriented (e.g. counterclockwise for a clockwise typed polygon), the result also depends on the strategy.
The default strategy returns still true if a point is completely within the reversed polygon. There is a specific strategy which returns false in this case.
