[def __this_function__ comparable_distance]

[heading_conformance_no_ogc __this_function__]

[heading Behaviour]
There is no (not yet) version with a strategy.

It depends on the coordinate system of the geometry's point type if there is
a strategy available which can determine (more efficient than the standard
strategy) a measure of comparable distance.

[heading Complexity]
Linear

[heading Example]
