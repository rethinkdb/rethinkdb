<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The primary motivation for beginning work on the Filesystem Library was 
frustration with Boost administrative tools.&nbsp; Scripts were written in 
Python, Perl, Bash, and Windows command languages.&nbsp; There was no single 
scripting language familiar and acceptable to all Boost administrators. Yet they 
were all skilled C++ programmers - why couldn't C++ be used as the scripting 
language?</p>

<p>The key feature C++ lacked for script-like applications was the ability to 
perform portable filesystem operations on directories and their contents. The 
Filesystem Library was developed to fill that void.</p>

<p>The intent is not to compete with traditional scripting languages, but to 
provide a solution for situations where C++ is already the language 
of choice..</p>

<h2><a name="Requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Be able to write portable script-style filesystem operations in modern 
  C++.<br>
  <br>
  Rationale: This is a common programming need. It is both an 
  embarrassment and a hardship that this is not possible with either the current 
  C++ or Boost libraries.&nbsp; The need is particularly acute 
  when C++ is the only toolset allowed in the tool chain.&nbsp; File system 
  operations are provided by many languages&nbsp;used on multiple platforms, 
  such as Perl and Python, as well as by many platform specific scripting 
  languages. All operating systems provide some form of API for filesystem 
  operations, and the POSIX bindings are increasingly available even on 
  operating systems not normally associated with POSIX, such as the Mac, z/OS, 
  or OS/390.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Work within the <a href="#Realities">realities</a> described below.<br>
  <br>
  Rationale: This isn't a research project. The need is for something that works on 
  today's platforms, including some of the embedded operating systems 
  with limited file systems. Because of the emphasis on portability, such a 
  library would be much more useful if standardized. That means being able to 
  work with a much wider range of platforms that just Unix or Windows and their 
  clones.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Avoid dangerous programming practices. Particularly, all-too-easy-to-ignore error notifications 
  and use of global variables.&nbsp;If a dangerous feature is provided, identify it as such.<br>
  <br>
  Rationale: Normally this would be covered by &quot;the usual Boost requirements...&quot;, 
  but it is mentioned explicitly because the equivalent native platform and 
  scripting language interfaces often depend on all-too-easy-to-ignore error 
  notifications and global variables like &quot;current 
  working directory&quot;.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Structure the library so that it is still useful even if some functionality 
  does not map well onto a given platform or directory tree. Particularly, much 
  useful functionality should be portable even to flat 
(non-hierarchical) filesystems.<br>
  <br>
  Rationale: Much functionality which does not 
  require a hierarchical directory structure is still useful on flat-structure 
  filesystems.&nbsp; There are many systems, particularly embedded systems, 
  where even very limited functionality is still useful.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Interface smoothly with current C++ Standard Library input/output 
  facilities.&nbsp; For example, paths should be 
  easy to use in std::basic_fstream constructors.<br>
  <br>
  Rationale: One of the most common uses of file system functionality is to 
  manipulate paths for eventual use in input/output operations.&nbsp; 
  Thus the need to interface smoothly with standard library I/O.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Suitable for eventual standardization. The implication of this requirement 
  is that the interface be close to minimal, and that great care be take 
  regarding portability.<br>
  <br>
  Rationale: The lack of file system operations is a serious hole 
  in the current standard, with no other known candidates to fill that hole. 
  Libraries with elaborate interfaces and difficult to port specifications are much less likely to be accepted for 
  standardization.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The usual Boost <a href="http://www.boost.org/more/lib_guide.htm">requirements and 
  guidelines</a> apply.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Encourage, but do not require, portability in path names.<br>
  <br>
  Rationale: For paths which originate from user input it is unreasonable to 
  require portable path syntax.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Avoid giving the illusion of portability where portability in fact does not 
  exist.<br>
  <br>
  Rationale: Leaving important behavior unspecified or &quot;implementation defined&quot; does a 
  great disservice to programmers using a library because it makes it appear 
  that code relying on the behavior is portable, when in fact there is nothing 
  portable about it. The only case where such under-specification is acceptable is when both users and implementors know from 
  other sources exactly what behavior is required, yet for some reason it isn't 
  possible to specify it exactly.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Realities">Realities</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Some operating systems have a single directory tree root, others have 
  multiple roots.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Some file systems provide both a long and short form of filenames.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Some file systems have different syntax for file paths and directory 
  paths.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Some file systems have different rules for valid file names and valid 
  directory names.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Some file systems (ISO-9660, level 1, for example) use very restricted 
  (so-called 8.3) file names.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Some operating systems allow file systems with different 
  characteristics to be &quot;mounted&quot; within a directory tree.&nbsp; Thus a 
  ISO-9660 or Windows 
  file system may end up as a sub-tree of a POSIX directory tree.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Wide-character versions of directory and file operations are available on some operating 
  systems, and not available on others.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>There is no law that says directory hierarchies have to be specified in 
  terms of left-to-right decent from the root.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Some file systems have a concept of file &quot;version number&quot; or &quot;generation 
  number&quot;.&nbsp; Some don't.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Not all operating systems use single character separators in path names.&nbsp; Some use 
  paired notations. A typical fully-specified OpenVMS filename
  might look something like this:<br>
  <br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; DISK$SCRATCH:[GEORGE.PROJECT1.DAT]BIG_DATA_FILE.NTP;5<br>
  </code><br>
  The general OpenVMS format is:<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  <i>Device:[directories.dot.separated]filename.extension;version_number</i><br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>For common file systems, determining if two descriptors are for same 
  entity is extremely difficult or impossible.&nbsp; For example, the concept of 
  equality can be different for each portion of a path - some portions may be 
  case or locale sensitive, others not. Case sensitivity is a property of the 
  pathname itself, and not the platform. Determining collating sequence is even 
  worse.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Race-conditions may occur. Directory trees, directories, files, and file attributes are in effect shared between all threads, processes, and computers which have access to the 
  filesystem.&nbsp; That may well include computers on the other side of the 
  world or in orbit around the world. This implies that file system operations 
  may fail in unexpected ways.&nbsp;For example:<br>
  <br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assert( exists(&quot;foo&quot;) == exists(&quot;foo&quot;) ); 
  // may fail!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assert( is_directory(&quot;foo&quot;) == is_directory(&quot;foo&quot;); 
  // may fail!<br>
  </code><br>
  In the first example, the file may have been deleted between calls to 
  exists().&nbsp; In the second example, the file may have been deleted and then 
  replaced by a directory of the same name between the calls to is_directory().<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Even though an application may be portable, it still will have to traffic 
  in system specific paths occasionally; user provided input is a common 
  example.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><a name="symbolic-link-use-case">Symbolic</a> links cause canonical and 
  normal form of some paths to represent different files or directories. For 
  example, given the directory hierarchy <code>/a/b/c</code>, with a symbolic 
  link in <code>/a</code> named <code>x</code>&nbsp; pointing to <code>b/c</code>, 
  then under POSIX Pathname Resolution rules a path of <code>&quot;/a/x/..&quot;</code> 
  should resolve to <code>&quot;/a/b&quot;</code>. If <code>&quot;/a/x/..&quot;</code> were first 
  normalized to <code>&quot;/a&quot;</code>, it would resolve incorrectly. (Case supplied 
  by Walter Landry.)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Rationale">Rationale</a></h2>

<p>The <a href="#Requirements">Requirements</a> and <a href="#Realities">
Realities</a> above drove much of the C++ interface design.&nbsp; In particular, 
the desire to make script-like code straightforward caused a great deal of 
effort to go into ensuring that apparently simple expressions like <i>exists( &quot;foo&quot; 
)</i> work as expected.</p>

<p>See the <a href="faq.htm">FAQ</a> for the rationale behind many detailed 
design decisions.</p>

<p>Several key insights went into the <i>path</i> class design:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decoupling of the input formats, internal conceptual (<i>vector&lt;string&gt;</i> 
  or other sequence) 
  model, and output formats.</li>
  <li>Providing two input formats (generic and O/S specific) broke a major 
  design deadlock.</li>
  <li>Providing several output formats solved another set of previously 
  intractable problems.</li>
  <li>Several non-obvious functions (particularly decomposition and composition) 
  are required to support portable code. (Peter Dimov, Thomas Witt, Glen 
  Knowles, others.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Error checking was a particularly difficult area. One key insight was that 
with file and directory names, portability isn't a universal truth.&nbsp; 
Rather, the programmer must think out the question &quot;What operating systems do I 
want this path to be portable to?&quot;&nbsp; By providing support for several 
answers to that question, the Filesystem Library alerts programmers of the need 
to ask it in the first place.</p>
<h2><a name="Abandoned_Designs">Abandoned Designs</a></h2>
<h3>operations.hpp</h3>
<p>Dietmar Kühl's original dir_it design and implementation supported 
wide-character file and directory names. It was abandoned after extensive 
discussions among Library Working Group members failed to identify portable 
semantics for wide-character names on systems not providing native support. See
<a href="faq.htm#wide-character_names">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>Previous iterations of the interface design used explicitly named functions providing a 
large number of convenience operations, with no compile-time or run-time 
options. There were so many function names that they were very confusing to use, 
and the interface was much larger. Any benefits seemed theoretical rather than 
real. </p>
<p>Designs based on compile time (rather than runtime) flag and option selection 
(via policy, enum, or int template parameters) became so complicated that they 
were abandoned, often after investing quite a bit of time and effort. The need 
to qualify attribute or option names with namespaces, even aliases, made use in 
template parameters ugly; that wasn't fully appreciated until actually writing 
real code.</p>
<p>Yet another set of convenience functions ( for example, <i>remove</i> with 
permissive, prune, recurse, and other options, plus predicate, and possibly 
other, filtering features) were abandoned because the details became both 
complex and contentious.</p>

<p>What is left is a toolkit of low-level operations from which the user can 
create more complex convenience operations, plus a very small number of 
convenience functions which were found to be useful enough to justify inclusion.</p>

<h3>path.hpp</h3>

<p>There were so many abandoned path designs, I've lost track. Policy-based 
class templates in several flavors, constructor supplied runtime policies, 
operation specific runtime policies, they were all considered, often 
implemented, and ultimately abandoned as far too complicated for any small 
benefits observed.</p>

<p>Additional design considerations apply to <a href="v3_design.html">Internationalization</a>. </p>

<h3>error checking</h3>

<p>A number of designs for the error checking machinery were abandoned, some 
after experiments with implementations. Totally automatic error checking was 
attempted in particular. But automatic error checking tended to make the overall 
library design much more complicated.</p>

<p>Some designs associated error checking mechanisms with paths.&nbsp; Some with 
operations functions.&nbsp; A policy-based error checking template design was 
partially implemented, then abandoned as too complicated for everyday 
script-like programs.</p>

<p>The final design, which depends partially on explicit error checking function 
calls,&nbsp; is much simpler and straightforward, although it does depend to 
some extent on programmer discipline.&nbsp; But it should allow programmers who 
are concerned about portability to be reasonably sure that their programs will 
work correctly on their choice of target systems.</p>
