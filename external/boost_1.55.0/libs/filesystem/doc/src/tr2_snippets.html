Filesystem Library Proposal (Revision 3)</h1>


<p>This paper proposes a filesystem library component suitable for a <i>C++ 
Standard Library Technical Specification</i> or for the <i>C++ Standard Library</i>. 
The proposed library is based on Version 3 of the Boost Filesystem 
Library (see <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/filesystem">
www.boost.org/libs/filesystem</a>). Preliminary wording is provided. A
<a href="#TODO">TODO</a> list identifies remaining work to be done.</p>

<h2>Revision history</h2>


<p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">D????=12-???? </span>, Filesystem 
Library Proposal (Revision 3). Changes include:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Add path::operator+= and concat functions to tack on things like suffixes 
  or numbers. Suggested by Ed Smith-Rowland and others.</li>
    <li>Add section tags and section numbers, per LWG 
    discussion in Kona.</li>
  <li>Bring use of trademarked names into ISO compliance, and minimize use of 
  such names by moving into a single examples section. Thanks to Stefanus Du 
  Toit for advice on how to do this.</li>
  <li>Introduce a definition for &quot;operating system dependent&quot;, and then use it 
  to replace most &quot;implementation defined behavior&quot;.</li>
  <li>Replace uses of&nbsp; const string return types with non-const string 
  return types, per LWG discussion in Kona.</li>
  <li>Remove permission for implementations to return const string&amp; in certain 
  cases, per LWG discussion in Kona.</li>
  <li>Remove path inserter and extractor dependency on Boost quoted manip (Issue 
  7).</li>
</ul>

include:</p>


  <ul>
    <li>Regenerated the proposed wording from the Boost Filesystem library 
    reference documentation, using an automated process. This process reduces 
    the likelihood of inadvertent discrepancies between descriptions.</li>
    <li>An <a href="#Issues-List">Issues list</a> was added, seeded with issues 
    raised by the LWG review of N3239 at the Bloomington meeting, and private 
    communications from LWG members.</li>
    <li>Namespace changed to <code>files</code> as an experiment. Made this 
    issue number 1 so the LWG can pass judgment.</li>
    <li>New functions were added, suggested by David Svoboda, to generate 
    canonical paths and manage permissions.</li>
    <li>More C++11 functionality was applied. This process is still incomplete, 
    however.</li>
    <li>Added proposed changes to header &lt;fstream&gt;. The previous paper had 
    inadvertently supplied the wrong wording.</li>
    <li>Continued the general cleanup of wording.</li>

<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3239.html">
N3239 = 11-0009</a>, Filesystem Library Update for TR2 (Preliminary), reflected 
changes made to the Boost library version 3 since the previously accepted 
committee paper:</p>


  <ul>
    <li>A single class <code>path</code> handles all aspects of 
    internationalization, replacing the previous template and its <code>path</code> 
    and <code>wpath</code> instantiations. Character types <code>char</code>,
    <code>wchar_t</code>, <code>char16_t</code>, and <code>char32_t</code> are 
    supported. This is a major simplification of the path abstraction, 
    particularly for functions that take path arguments. This change was based 
    on a suggestion by Peter Dimov.</li>
    <li>Several operational functions have been added, including much better 
    symlink support, the ability to resize a file, and the ability to generate a 
    unique path.</li>
    <li>Support for error reporting via <code>error_code</code> is now uniform 
    throughout the operations functions.</li>
    <li>Several functions have been renamed, based on feedback from users.</li>
  </ul>


<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n1975.html">
N1975 = 06-0045</a>, Filesystem Library Proposal for TR2 (Revision 3), was 
adopted by the committee in April, 2006, at the Berlin meeting. Shortly 
afterward the Library Working Group set aside work on TR2 to concentrate on 
C++0x.</p>


<h2>Motivation and Scope</h2>


<p>The motivation and scope for a filesystem library were described in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n1975.html">
N1975</a>, and are not repeated here. A minor scope reduction is that an 
addition to the current C++ runtime library is no longer needed.</p>


<p>Boost Filesystem Version 3  introduced a single path type that interoperates well with both <code>
basic_string</code> and user defined string types. Thus the following Design 
alternatives paragraph is no long applicable:</p>


  <blockquote>


<p><strike><i>Single path type which can at runtime accept narrow or wide character 
pathnames.</i> Although certainly interesting, and possibly superior, such a 
design would not interoperate well with the current Standard Library's 
compile-time typed <code>basic_string</code>. A new runtime polymorphic string 
class would be the best place to experiment with this concept, not a path class.</strike></p>


  </blockquote>


  <h2><a name="TODO">TODO</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply more C++0X features. Boost.Filesystem needs to implement these to verify their 
    application is correct.</li>
    <li>Ion Todirel suggests &quot;Would be nice if path::append was variadic, to 
    improve usability&quot;.</li>
    <li>Boost.Filesystem needs to implement <code>char16_t</code> and <code>char32_t</code> support to verify the 
    specification for these is correct.</li>
    <li>The Boost implementation has more class path non-member relational 
    functions that shown in the docs, and the specific set of relational 
    functions varies between Windows and POSIX. Figure out what's happening and 
    document it.</li>
    <li><code><a href="#Source">Source</a></code> is not specified as actually 
    implemented. Expose <code>path_traits</code>?</li>
    <li><i>Effects</i> for <code>copy</code> and <code>copy_directory</code> 
    need to be reviewed, revised, tested, peer reviewed.</li>
    <li>Dinkumware/Microsoft report slightly different results for Decomposition 
    table. Rerun table. Check discrepancies.</li>
    <li>Apply issue resolutions from Kona. Complete except some remaining 
    codecvt arguments</li>
    <li>Review Nick Stoughton's email for suggestions, action items.</li>
    <li>Change <code>time_t</code> to <code>chrono system_clock::time_point</code>, 
    per LWG discussion in Kona. </li>
    <li>Ed Smith-Rowland:<br>
    &gt; I found it less confusing to switch to positive logic for 
    recursive_directory_iterator:<br>
    &gt; bool no_push_pending() const noexcept;<br>
    &gt; to say<br>
    &gt; bool is_push_pending() const noexcept;<br>
    &gt;<br>
    &gt; and<br>
    &gt; void no_push(bool value=true);<br>
    &gt; to say<br>
    &gt; void push_pending(bool value=false);<br>
    &gt; or<br>
    &gt; void set_push_pending(bool value=false);<br>
    &gt; I found it less confusing and I think other parts of the library strive 
    for this.</li>
    <li>recursive_directory_iterator is specified in terms of private data 
    members. Remove these (including the comment!) and specify in terms of 
    behavior only.</li>
    <li>Ion Todirel: Would be nice to have a make_relative. Need to review 
    similar suggestions.</li>

<h2><a name="Issues-List">Issues List</a></h2>
<hr>
<h3>Issue 1: What is the appropriate namespace?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status: 
Tentatively resolved</h3>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The N3335 proposal places the library in namespace <code>std::tr2::files</code>. 
Rationale for a sub-namespace is that the library uses several names that don't 
seem appropriate for namespace <code>tr2</code> since full standardization would 
then put the names into <code>std</code>. The function names <code>remove</code> 
and <code>rename</code> are of particular concern because these functions differ 
in behavior from current standard library functions with those names. It also 
doesn't seem desirable to preempt names like <code>equivalent</code> and <code>
status</code>.</p>
<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p><i>Kona: Strong support for <code>filesystem</code> as the library's 
namespace. Strong support for a technical specification namespace that alerts uses that 
contents are likely to change if and when they later get moved into the 
standard. </i></p>
<p><i>No decision yet on a TR namespace; <code>tbs</code> being used as 
a placeholder. Thus the full namespace is changed to <code>
std::tbs::filesystem.</code></i></p>
<hr>
<h3>Issue 2: Excessive use of <code>const codecvt_type&amp;</code> arguments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Status: Open</h3>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Users sometimes need to do path conversions that use something other than the 
imbued codecvt facet. The need is particularly acute in multi-threaded 
applications where changing the imbued facet would introduce a data race. That 
said, providing an optional <code>const codecvt_type&amp;</code> argument for every 
function where the need might possibly arise is excessive because its use is so 
rare and it adds considerable interface clutter.</p>
<h4>Proposed resolution</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><i>Kona:</i></p>
<p dir="ltr"><i>Remove all existing class path <code>const codecvt_type&amp;</code> 
arguments. </i></p>
<p dir="ltr"><i>Beman to pursue separate encoding conversion functionality, per 
Thursday N3336 &quot;Adapting standard library strings and IO to a Unicode World&quot; 
discussion. See Kona wiki.</i></p>
<p dir="ltr"><i>If a separate encoding conversion facility isn't possible, then 
some form of minimal class path encoding conversion facility will be needed. 
But..., the LWG would like to see use cases and clearer explanation of 
motivation before deciding on specifics, and be very sure that there is no way 
to achieve with existing std library functionality, albeit with some loss of 
efficiency.</i></p>
<hr>
<h3>Issue 3: Possible &quot;implicit cast to native type&quot;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Status: Open</h3>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>In Bloomington there was discussion of &quot;implicit cast to implicit cast to 
native OS type to inter operate with existing iostream library and native 
functions instead of modifying fstream&quot;.</p>
<h4>Proposed resolution</h4>
<p><i>Kona: The Dinkumware/Microsoft implementation has added an implicit 
conversion to the string type, eliminating any need to modify fstream. 
(Discussion: might be safer to make the implicit conversion protected, then make 
fstream classes friends).</i></p>
<p><i>Action: Beman to investigate, test, as avoiding modification of existing 
header and classes is much desired.</i></p>
<hr>
<h3>Issue 4: Given move semantics, it is best not to return const strings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Status: Resolved</h3>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The issue title pretty much says it all.</p>
<h4>Proposed resolution</h4>
<p><i>Kona: Return plain strings. Remove the permission for implementations to 
return const refs, since uses are not in performace critical code and subtle 
portability bugs may occur.</i></p>
<p><i>Action: Beman to apply to proposed wording.</i></p>
<p><i>Version 3: Resolution applied.</i></p>
<hr>
<h3>Issue 5: Is there a way to handle characters that are illegal for particular 
OS?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status: NAD</h3>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Question raised by Pablo in Bloomington.</p>
<h4>Proposed resolution</h4>
<p>Beman suggests NAD, Future. I've done some work on this, including looking at 
systems like OpenVMS that have an escape mechanism to handle otherwise 
unrepresentable characters. There was a comment to that effect in N3239. I 
believe it should be deferred to some future release since (1) it is complex 
enough that I'd like to see actual implementation and use experience (presumably 
via Boost), and (2) I can't recall a user ever requesting such a feature.</p>
<p><i>Kona: No consensus for change, since there doesn't appear to be any 
compelling use case.</i></p>
<hr>
<h3>Issue 6: Could allocator support be added to class path?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Status: Open</h3>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Question raised by a committee member in private email.</p>
<p><i>Kona: Much discussion.</i></p>
<p><i>Action: Alisdair to write paper, based on a real implementation, so that 
it is possible to assess the impact on interface, performance, etc.</i></p>
<p><i>Post-Kona: Alisdair will defer paper until after TR. </i></p>
<hr>
<h3>Issue 7: How should class path inserter and extractor be specified?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Status: Resolved</h3>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Class <code>path</code> currently is specified to used the Boost detail <code>
quoted</code> stream manipulator. A path object is inserted delimited by quotes, 
and extracted accordingly, ensuring that paths containing spaces are 
round-tripped correctly.&nbsp; Quotes in the path itself are escaped, and io 
state is saved and restored.</p>
<p>See
<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_48_0/libs/io/doc/quoted_manip.html">
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_48_0/libs/io/doc/quoted_manip.html</a></p>
<p>Since the standard can't specify behavior in terms of something in Boost, we 
have to change the specification. Since the <code>quoted</code> stream 
manipulator is a handy little component, the issue is raised as to whether it 
should go in TR2.</p>
<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p><i>Kona: Specify the path inserter and extractor to have the desired 
behavior without reference to how it is achieved. (If someone wants to propose a 
quoted manipulator, that's a separate proposal for a different TR.)</i></p>
<p><i>Action:&nbsp; Beman to apply to proposed wording.</i></p>
<p><i>Version 3: Resolution applied.</i></p>
<hr>
<h3>Issue 8: Rename <code>rename</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Status: New</h3>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>There are minor problems with the name of the <code>rename()</code> function:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is already a &quot;rename&quot; function, albeit in namespace std, and it has 
  different semantics as regards error handling. Thus giving the function a 
  different name might reduce the chance of user error.</li>
  <li>The name &quot;move&quot; would&nbsp; better reflect the actual semantics, 
  particularly for moves between directories., and this is the name used by some 
  API's, console commands, and GUI file managers for that functionality.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Proposed resolution</h4>
<p>Change the name of the <code>rename()</code> function to <code>move()</code>.</p>
