[section Construct, New, Delete, Casts]

You'll probably want to work with objects. There are lazy versions of
constructor calls, `new`, `delete` and the suite of C++ casts. Examples:

    construct<std::string>(arg1, arg2)  // constructs a std::string from arg1, arg2
    new_<std::string>(arg1, arg2)       // makes a new std::string from arg1, arg2
    delete_(arg1)                       // deletes arg1 (assumed to be a pointer)
    static_cast_<int*>(arg1)            // static_cast's arg1 to an int*

[note Take note that, by convention, names that conflict with C++
reserved words are appended with a single trailing underscore `'_'`]
