[section More]

As mentioned earlier, this chapter is not a thorough discourse of the library.
It is meant only to cover enough ground to get you into high gear as quickly as
possible. Some advanced stuff is not discussed here (e.g. [link phoenix.modules.scope
Scopes]); nor are features that provide alternative (short-hand) ways to do the
same things (e.g. [link phoenix.modules.bind Bind] vs. [link phoenix.modules.function Lazy Functions]).
