[section Phoenix 3.0]

This is the first official release of Phoenix as first class Boost citizen. As a
consequence of the review of Phoenix V2 the internals got completely rewritten.
Therefore the internal extension mechanism is different.

* composite<...>, as_composite<...> and compose are gone and have been replaced.
  For an in depth discussion see the section [link phoenix.inside Inside Phoenix]
* [link phoenix.modules.function] phoenix::function now supports function objects
  that implement the __boost_result_of__ protocol. *This is a breaking change*
  
  [/as well as the old return type
  deduction protocol. The same is true for [link phoenix.modules.bind Bind].]
* Boilerplate macros to easily adapt already existing functions and function
  objects
* [link phoenix.modules.bind Bind] is no completely compatible with Boost.Bind
