[section Macros that describe C++03 defects]

The following macros all describe features that are required by the C++03 standard,
if one of the following macros is defined, then it represents a defect in the
compiler's conformance with the 2003 standard.


[table
[[Macro        ][Section     ][ Description          ]]


[[`BOOST_BCB_PARTIAL_SPECIALIZATION_BUG`][Compiler][
The compiler exhibits certain partial specialisation bug - probably Borland
C++ Builder specific.
]]
[[`BOOST_FUNCTION_SCOPE_USING_DECLARATION_BREAKS_ADL`][Compiler][
Argument dependent lookup fails if there is a using declaration for the
symbol being looked up in the current scope.  For example, using
`boost::get_pointer`; prevents ADL from finding overloads of `get_pointer`
in namespaces nested inside boost (but not elsewhere).  Probably
Borland specific.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_ADL_BARRIER`][Compiler][
The compiler locates and searches namespaces that it should /*not*/ in fact 
search when performing argument dependent lookup.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_ARGUMENT_DEPENDENT_LOOKUP`][Compiler][
Compiler does not implement argument-dependent lookup (also named
Koenig lookup); see std::3.4.2 \[basic.koenig.lookup\]
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_AUTO_PTR`][Standard library][
If the compiler / library supplies non-standard or broken `std::auto_ptr`.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_COMPLETE_VALUE_INITIALIZATION`][Compiler][ 
Compiler has not completely implemented value-initialization. 
See also [@../../../utility/value_init.htm#compiler_issues The Utility\/Value Init docs] 
]] 
[[`BOOST_NO_CTYPE_FUNCTIONS`][Platform][
The Platform does not provide functions for the character-classifying
operations `<ctype.h>` and `<cctype>`, only macros.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_CV_SPECIALIZATIONS`][Compiler][
If template specialisations for cv-qualified types conflict with a
specialisation for a cv-unqualififed type.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_CV_VOID_SPECIALIZATIONS`][Compiler][
If template specialisations for cv-void types conflict with a specialisation
for void.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_CWCHAR`][Platform][
The Platform does not provide `<wchar.h>` and `<cwchar>`.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_CWCTYPE`][Platform][
The Platform does not provide `<wctype.h>` and `<cwctype>`.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_FENV_H`][Platform, Standard library][
The C standard library doesn't provide `<fenv.h>`. [@../../../../boost/detail/fenv.hpp
`<boost/detail/fenv.hpp>`] should be included instead of `<fenv.h>` for maximum
portability on platforms which do provide `<fenv.h>`. 
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_DEPENDENT_NESTED_DERIVATIONS`][Compiler][
The compiler fails to compile a nested class that has a dependent base class:
``
template<typename T>
struct foo : {
   template<typename U>
   struct bar : public U {};
``
};
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_DEPENDENT_TYPES_IN_TEMPLATE_VALUE_PARAMETERS`][Compiler][
Template value parameters cannot have a dependent type, for example:
``
template<class T, typename T::type value> 
class X { ... };
``
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_EXCEPTION_STD_NAMESPACE`][Standard Library][
The standard library does not put some or all of the contents of
`<exception>` in namespace std.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_EXCEPTIONS`][Compiler][
The compiler does not support exception handling (this setting is typically
required by many C++ compilers for embedded platforms). Note that there is
no requirement for boost libraries to honor this configuration setting -
indeed doing so may be impossible in some cases. Those libraries that do
honor this will typically abort if a critical error occurs - you have been
warned!
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_FUNCTION_TEMPLATE_ORDERING`][Compiler][
The compiler does not perform function template ordering or its function
template ordering is incorrect.
``
// #1
template<class T> void f(T);

// #2
template<class T,class U> void f(T(*)(U));

void bar(int);

f(&bar); // should choose #2.
``
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_INCLASS_MEMBER_INITIALIZATION`][Compiler][
Compiler violates std::9.4.2/4.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_INTRINSIC_WCHAR_T`][Compiler][
The C++ implementation does not provide `wchar_t`, or it is really a synonym
for another integral type. Use this symbol to decide whether it is appropriate
to explicitly specialize a template on `wchar_t` if there is already a
specialization for other integer types.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_IOSFWD`][std lib][
The standard library lacks `<iosfwd>`.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_IOSTREAM`][std lib][
The standard library lacks `<iostream>`, `<istream>` or `<ostream>`.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_IS_ABSTRACT`][Compiler][
The C++ compiler does not support SFINAE with abstract types, this is covered
by __CORE_LANGUAGE_DR337__, but is not part of the current standard.  Fortunately
most compilers that support SFINAE also support this DR.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_LIMITS`][Standard library][
The C++ implementation does not provide the `<limits>` header. Never check for
this symbol in library code; always include `<boost/limits.hpp>`, which
guarantees to provide `std::numeric_limits`.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_CXX11_NUMERIC_LIMITS`][Standard library][
C++11 additions to `std::numeric_limits` are not available for use.
`static function numeric_limits<T>::lowest()` the lowest finite value representable by the numeric type.
`static int const max_digits10` the number of decimal digits that are required to make sure that two distinct values of the type have distinct decimal representations.
`template<> class numeric_limits<char16_t>;`, see also `BOOST_NO_CXX11_CHAR16_T`, 
`template<> class numeric_limits<char32_t>;` see also `BOOST_NO_CXX11_CHAR32_T`.
Replaces BOOST_NO_NUMERIC_LIMITS_LOWEST.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_LIMITS_COMPILE_TIME_CONSTANTS`][Standard library][
Constants such as `numeric_limits<T>::is_signed` are not available for use
at compile-time.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_LONG_LONG_NUMERIC_LIMITS`][Standard library][
There is no specialization for `numeric_limits<long long>` and
`numeric_limits<unsigned long long>`. `<boost/limits.hpp>` will then add these
specializations as a standard library "fix" only if the compiler supports the
`long long` datatype.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_MEMBER_FUNCTION_SPECIALIZATIONS`][Compiler][
The compiler does not support the specialization of individual member
functions of template classes.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_MEMBER_TEMPLATE_KEYWORD`][Compiler][
If the compiler supports member templates, but not the template keyword
when accessing member template classes.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_MEMBER_TEMPLATE_FRIENDS`][Compiler][
Member template friend syntax (`template<class P> friend class frd;`)
described in the C++ Standard, 14.5.3, not supported.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_MEMBER_TEMPLATES`][Compiler][
Member template functions not fully supported.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_MS_INT64_NUMERIC_LIMITS`][Standard library][
There is no specialization for `numeric_limits<__int64>` and
`numeric_limits<unsigned __int64>`. `<boost/limits.hpp>` will then add these
specializations as a standard library "fix", only if the compiler supports
the `__int64` datatype.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_NESTED_FRIENDSHIP`][Compiler][
Compiler doesn't allow a nested class to access private members of its
containing class. Probably Borland/CodeGear specific.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_OPERATORS_IN_NAMESPACE`][Compiler][
Compiler requires inherited operator friend functions to be defined at
namespace scope, then using'ed to boost. Probably GCC specific. See
[@../../../../boost/operators.hpp `<boost/operators.hpp>`] for example.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_PARTIAL_SPECIALIZATION_IMPLICIT_DEFAULT_ARGS`][Compiler][
The compiler does not correctly handle partial specializations
which depend upon default arguments in the primary template.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_POINTER_TO_MEMBER_CONST`][Compiler][
The compiler does not correctly handle pointers to const member functions,
preventing use of these in overloaded function templates. See
[@../../../../boost/functional.hpp `<boost/functional.hpp>`] for example.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_POINTER_TO_MEMBER_TEMPLATE_PARAMETERS`][Compiler][
Pointers to members don't work when used as template parameters.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_PRIVATE_IN_AGGREGATE`][Compiler][
The compiler misreads 8.5.1, treating classes as non-aggregate if they
contain private or protected member functions.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_RTTI`][Compiler][
The compiler may (or may not) have the typeid operator, but RTTI on the dynamic type
of an object is not supported.
]]

The compiler does not support the "Substitution Failure Is Not An Error"
meta-programming idiom.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_SFINAE_EXPR`][Compiler][

The C++ standard library does not provide a standards conforming
`std::allocator`.

The C++ implementation fails to provide the `std::iterator` class.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_STD_ITERATOR_TRAITS`][Standard library][
The compiler does not provide a standard compliant implementation of
`std::iterator_traits`. Note that the compiler may still have a
non-standard implementation.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_STD_LOCALE`][Standard library][
The standard library lacks `std::locale`.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_STD_MESSAGES`][Standard library][
The standard library lacks a conforming `std::messages` facet.

The C++ standard library does not provide the `min()` and `max()` template
functions that should be in `<algorithm>`.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_STD_OUTPUT_ITERATOR_ASSIGN`][Standard library][
Defined if the standard library's output iterators are not assignable.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_STD_TYPEINFO`][Standard library][
The <typeinfo> header declares `type_info` in the global namespace instead of namespace std.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_STD_USE_FACET`][Standard library][
The standard library lacks a conforming `std::use_facet`.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_STD_WSTREAMBUF`][Standard library][
The standard library's implementation of `std::basic_streambuf<wchar_t>`
is either missing, incomplete, or buggy.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_STD_WSTRING`][Standard library][
The standard library lacks `std::wstring`.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_STDC_NAMESPACE`][Compiler, Platform][
The contents of C++ standard headers for C library functions
(the `<c...>` headers) have not been placed in namespace std. This test is
difficult - some libraries "fake" the std C functions by adding using
declarations to import them into namespace std, unfortunately they don't
necessarily catch all of them...
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_STRINGSTREAM`][Standard library][
The C++ implementation does not provide the `<sstream>` header.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_SWPRINTF`][Platform][
The platform does not have a conforming version of `swprintf`.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_TEMPLATE_PARTIAL_SPECIALIZATION`][Compiler][
Class template partial specialization (14.5.4 \[temp.class.spec\]) not
supported.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_TEMPLATED_IOSTREAMS`][Standard library][

The compiler does not support the typeid operator at all.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_TYPENAME_WITH_CTOR`][Compiler][
The typename keyword cannot be used when creating a temporary of a
Dependent type.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_UNREACHABLE_RETURN_DETECTION`][Compiler][
If a return is unreachable, then no return statement should be required,
however some compilers insist on it, while other issue a bunch of warnings
if it is in fact present.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_USING_DECLARATION_OVERLOADS_FROM_TYPENAME_BASE`][Compiler][
The compiler will not accept a using declaration that brings a function
from a typename used as a base class into a derived class if functions of
the same name are present in the derived class.
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_USING_TEMPLATE`][Compiler][
The compiler will not accept a using declaration that imports a template
class or function from another namespace. Originally a Borland specific
problem with imports to/from the global namespace, extended to MSVC6
which has a specific issue with importing template classes (but not
functions).
]]
[[`BOOST_NO_VOID_RETURNS`][Compiler][
The compiler does not allow a void function to return the result of calling
another void function.
``
void f() {}
void g() { return f(); }
``
]]

[section Macros that allow use of C++11 features with C++03 compilers]

The following macros allow use of C++11 features even with compilers that do not yet
provide compliant C++11 support.

[table
[[Macro        ][ Description          ]]

[[`BOOST_ALIGNMENT(X)`, `BOOST_NO_ALIGNMENT`][
Some compilers don't support the `alignas` keyword but provide other means to specify alignment
(usually, through compiler-specific attributes). The macro `BOOST_ALIGNMENT(X)` will expand to the `alignas(X)`
keyword if the compiler supports it or to some compiler-specific attribute to achieve the specified alignment.
If no such compiler-specific attribute is known then `BOOST_ALIGNMENT(X)` will expand to nothing and
`BOOST_NO_ALIGNMENT` will be defined. Unlike native `alignas`, `X` must always be a compile-time integer constant.
The macro can be used to specify alignment of types and data:
``
  struct BOOST_ALIGNMENT(16) my_data
  {
      char c[16];
  };
  BOOST_ALIGNMENT(8) int arr[32];
``
]]
[[`BOOST_CONSTEXPR`][
Some compilers don't support the use of `constexpr`. This macro expands to nothing on those compilers, and `constexpr`
elsewhere. For example, when defining a constexpr function or constructor replace:
``
  constexpr tuple();
``
with:
``
  BOOST_CONSTEXPR tuple();
``
]]
[[`BOOST_CONSTEXPR_OR_CONST`][
Some compilers don't support the use of `constexpr`. This macro expands to `const` on those compilers, and `constexpr`
elsewhere. For example, when defining const expr variables replace:
``
  static constexpr UIntType xor_mask = a;
``
with:
``
  static BOOST_CONSTEXPR_OR_CONST UIntType xor_mask = a;
``
]]
[[`BOOST_STATIC_CONSTEXPR`][
This is a shortcut for `static BOOST_CONSTEXPR_OR_CONST`. For example, when defining const expr variables replace:
``
  static constexpr UIntType xor_mask = a;
``
with:
``
  BOOST_STATIC_CONSTEXPR UIntType xor_mask = a;
``
]]
[[`BOOST_DEFAULTED_FUNCTION(fun, body)`][
This macro is intended to be used within a class definition in order to declare a default implementation of function `fun`.
For the compilers that do not support C++11 defaulted functions the macro will expand into an inline function definition
with the `body` implementation. For example:
``
  struct my_struct
  {
      BOOST_DEFAULTED_FUNCTION(my_struct(), {})
  };
``
is equivalent to:
``
  struct my_struct
  {
      my_struct() = default;
  };
``
or:
``
  struct my_struct
  {
      my_struct() {}
  };
``
]]
[[`BOOST_DELETED_FUNCTION(fun)`][
This macro is intended to be used within a class definition in order to declare a deleted function `fun`.
For the compilers that do not support C++11 deleted functions the macro will expand into a private function
declaration with no definition. Since the macro may change the access mode, it is recommended to use this macro
at the end of the class definition. For example:
``
  struct noncopyable
  {
      BOOST_DELETED_FUNCTION(noncopyable(noncopyable const&))
      BOOST_DELETED_FUNCTION(noncopyable& operator= (noncopyable const&))
  };
``
is equivalent to:
``
  struct noncopyable
  {
      noncopyable(noncopyable const&) = delete;
      noncopyable& operator= (noncopyable const&) = delete;
  };
``
or:
``
  struct noncopyable
  {
  private:
      noncopyable(noncopyable const&);
      noncopyable& operator= (noncopyable const&);
  };
``
]]
[[
``
  BOOST_NOEXCEPT
  BOOST_NOEXCEPT_OR_NOTHROW
  BOOST_NOEXCEPT_IF(Predicate)
  BOOST_NOEXCEPT_EXPR(Expression)
``
][
If `BOOST_NO_CXX11_NOEXCEPT` is defined (i.e. C++03 compliant compilers) these macros are defined as:
[:
``
  #define BOOST_NOEXCEPT
  #define BOOST_NOEXCEPT_OR_NOTHROW throw()
  #define BOOST_NOEXCEPT_IF(Predicate)
  #define BOOST_NOEXCEPT_EXPR(Expression) false
``
]
If `BOOST_NO_CXX11_NOEXCEPT` is not defined (i.e. C++11 compliant compilers) they are defined as:
[:
``
  #define BOOST_NOEXCEPT noexcept
  #define BOOST_NOEXCEPT_OR_NOTHROW noexcept
  #define BOOST_NOEXCEPT_IF(Predicate) noexcept((Predicate))
  #define BOOST_NOEXCEPT_EXPR(Expression) noexcept((Expression))
``
]
]]
[[`BOOST_MSVC_ENABLE_2012_NOV_CTP`][
For Microsoft Visual C++ 2012, enable the C++11 features supplied by the
November 2012 Community Technology Preview. These features are not automatically
enabled because the CTP is non-supported alpha code that is not recommended
for production use. This macro must be defined before including any Boost headers,
and must be defined for all translation units in the program, including Boost library builds.
This macro will no longer have any effect once an official Microsoft
release supports the CTP features.

[#config_helpers]

[section Boost Helper Macros]

The following macros are either simple helpers, or macros that provide
workarounds for compiler/standard library defects.


[table
[[Macro           ][Description            ]]

[[`BOOST_WORKAROUND`][
This macro is used where a compiler specific workaround is required that is not otherwise
described by one of the other Boost.Config macros.  To use the macro you must first
``
#include <boost/detail/workaround.hpp>
``
usage is then:
``
#if BOOST_WORKAROUND(MACRONAME, CONDITION)
   // workaround code goes here...
#else
   // Standard conforming code goes here...
#endif
``
where `MACRONAME` is a macro that usually describes the version number to be tested against, and `CONDITION`
is a comparison operator followed by a value.  For example `BOOST_WORKAROUND(BOOST_INTEL, <= 1010)` would 
evaluate to `1` for Intel C++ 10.1 and earlier.  

The macro can also be used with `BOOST_TESTED_AT` if all
current compiler versions exhibit the issue, but the issue is expected to be fixed at some later point.  

For example
`BOOST_WORKAROUND(__BORLANDC__, BOOST_TESTED_AT(0x590))` would normally evaluate to `1` for all values
of `__BORLANDC__` /unless/ the macro `BOOST_DETECT_OUTDATED_WORKAROUNDS` is defined, in which case evaluates to
`(__BORLANDC__ <= 0x590)`.

[*Note]: the ultimate source of documentation for this macro is in [@../../../../boost/detail/workaround.hpp boost/detail/workaround.hpp].
]]
[[`BOOST_PREVENT_MACRO_SUBSTITUTION`][
Sometimes you have a function name with the same name as a C macro, for example "min" and "max"
member functions, in which case one can prevent the function being expanded as a macro using:
``
someclass.min BOOST_PREVENT_MACRO_SUBSTITUTION(arg1, arg2);
``
The following also works in most, but not all, contexts:
``
(someclass.max)(arg1, arg2);
``
]]
[[`BOOST_DEDUCED_TYPENAME`][
Some compilers don't support the use of typename for dependent types in deduced
contexts. This macro expands to nothing on those compilers, and typename
elsewhere. For example, replace:
`template <class T> void f(T, typename T::type);`
with:
`template <class T> void f(T, BOOST_DEDUCED_TYPENAME T::type);`
]]
[[`BOOST_HASH_MAP_HEADER`][
The header to include to get the SGI `hash_map` class. This macro is only
available if `BOOST_HAS_HASH` is defined.
]]
[[`BOOST_HASH_SET_HEADER`][
The header to include to get the SGI `hash_set` class. This macro is only
available if `BOOST_HAS_HASH` is defined.
]]
[[`BOOST_SLIST_HEADER`][
The header to include to get the SGI `slist` class. This macro is only
available if `BOOST_HAS_SLIST` is defined.
]]
[[`BOOST_STD_EXTENSION_NAMESPACE`][
The namespace used for std library extensions (hashtable classes etc).
]]
[[`BOOST_STATIC_CONSTANT(Type, assignment)`][
On compilers which don't allow in-class initialization of static integral
constant members, we must use enums as a workaround if we want the constants
to be available at compile-time. This macro gives us a convenient way to
declare such constants.
For example instead of:
``
struct foo{
   static const int value = 2;
};
``
use:
``
struct foo{
   BOOST_STATIC_CONSTANT(int, value = 2);
};
``
]]
[[`BOOST_UNREACHABLE_RETURN(result)`][
Normally evaluates to nothing, but evaluates to return x; if the compiler
requires a return, even when it can never be reached.
]]
[[`BOOST_FALLTHROUGH`][ 
The BOOST_FALLTHROUGH macro can be used to annotate implicit fall-through 
between switch labels: 
`` 
 switch (x) { 
 case 40: 
 case 41: 
    if (truth_is_out_there) { 
       ++x; 
       BOOST_FALLTHROUGH;  // Use instead of/along with annotations in 
       // comments. 
    } else { 
      return x; 
    } 
    case 42: 
       ... 
`` 
As shown in the example above, the BOOST_FALLTHROUGH macro should be 
followed by a semicolon. It is designed to mimic control-flow statements 
like 'break;', so it can be placed in most places where 'break;' can, but 
only if there are no statements on the execution path between it and the 
next switch label. 

When compiled with Clang >3.2 in C++11 mode, the BOOST_FALLTHROUGH macro is 
expanded to `[[clang::fallthrough]]` attribute, which is analysed when 
performing switch labels fall-through diagnostic ('-Wimplicit-fallthrough'). 
See clang [@http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#clang__fallthrough 
documentation on language extensions for details.] 

When used with unsupported compilers, the BOOST_FALLTHROUGH macro has no 
effect on diagnostics. 

In either case this macro has no effect on runtime behavior and performance 
of code. 
]] 
[[`BOOST_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_TYPE(t)`
  `BOOST_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_NON_TYPE(t,v)`
  `BOOST_APPEND_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_TYPE(t)`
  `BOOST_APPEND_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_NON_TYPE(t,v)`][
Some compilers silently "fold" different function template instantiations if
some of the template parameters don't appear in the function parameter list.
For instance:
``
  #include <iostream>
  #include <ostream>
  #include <typeinfo>

  template <int n>
  void f() { std::cout << n << ' '; }

  template <typename T>
  void g() { std::cout << typeid(T).name() << ' '; }

  int main() {
    f<1>();
    f<2>();

    g<int>();
    g<double>();
  }
``
incorrectly outputs [^2 2 double double] on VC++ 6. These macros, to be used
in the function parameter list, fix the problem without effects on the calling
syntax. For instance, in the case above write:
``
  template <int n>
  void f(BOOST_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_NON_TYPE(int, n)) { ... }

  template <typename T>
  void g(BOOST_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_TYPE(T)) { ... }
``
Beware that they can declare (for affected compilers) a dummy defaulted
parameter, so they

[*a)] should be always invoked [*at the end] of the parameter list

[*b)] can't be used if your function template is multiply declared.

Furthermore, in order to add any needed comma separator, an `APPEND_*` version
must be used when the macro invocation appears after a normal parameter
declaration or after the invocation of another macro of this same group.
]]
[[`BOOST_USE_FACET(Type, loc)`][
When the standard library does not have a conforming `std::use_facet` there
are various workarounds available, but they differ from library to library.
This macro provides a consistent way to access a locale's facets. For example,
replace:
`std::use_facet<Type>(loc);`
with:
`BOOST_USE_FACET(Type, loc);`
Note do not add a `std::` prefix to the front of `BOOST_USE_FACET`.
]]
[[`BOOST_HAS_FACET(Type, loc)`][
When the standard library does not have a comforming `std::has_facet` there
are various workarounds available, but they differ from library to library.
This macro provides a consistent way to check a locale's facets. For example,
replace:
`std::has_facet<Type>(loc);`
with:
`BOOST_HAS_FACET(Type, loc);`
Note do not add a `std::` prefix to the front of `BOOST_HAS_FACET`.
]]
[[`BOOST_NESTED_TEMPLATE`][
Member templates are supported by some compilers even though they can't use
the `A::template member<U>` syntax, as a workaround replace:
`typedef typename A::template rebind<U> binder;`
with:
`typedef typename A::BOOST_NESTED_TEMPLATE rebind<U> binder;`
]]
[[`BOOST_STRINGIZE(X)`][
Converts the parameter `X` to a string after macro replacement on `X` has
been performed.
]]
[[`BOOST_JOIN(X,Y)`][
This piece of macro magic joins the two arguments together, even when one of
the arguments is itself a macro (see 16.3.1 in C++ standard). This is normally
used to create a mangled name in combination with a predefined macro such a
\_\_LINE__.
]]
[[`BOOST_FORCEINLINE`][
This macro can be used in place of the `inline` keyword to instruct the compiler
that a function should always be inlined.
Overuse of this macro can lead to significant bloat, while good use can increase
performance in certain cases, such as computation-intensive code built through
generative programming techniques.

Usage example:
``
  template<class T>
  BOOST_FORCEINLINE T& f(T& t)
  {
      return t;
  }
``

Note that use of this macro can lead to cryptic error messages with some compilers.
Consider defining it to `inline` before including the Boost.Config header in order to be
able to debug errors more easily.
]]
[[`BOOST_NOINLINE`][
This macro can be used in place of the `inline` keyword to instruct the compiler
that a function should never be inlined. One should typically use this macro
to mark functions that are unlikely to be called, such as error handling routines.

Usage example:
``
  BOOST_NOINLINE void handle_error(const char* descr)
  {
      // ...
  }
``
]]
[[`BOOST_LIKELY(X)`
  `BOOST_UNLIKELY(X)`][
These macros communicate to the compiler that the conditional expression `X` is likely
or unlikely to yield a positive result. The expression should result in a boolean value.
The result of the macro is an integer or boolean value equivalent to the result of `X`.

The macros are intended to be used in branching statements. The additional hint they provide
can be used by the compiler to arrange the compiled code of the branches more effectively.

Usage example:
``
  if (BOOST_UNLIKELY(ptr == NULL))
    handle_error("ptr is NULL");
``

[section Macros for libraries with separate source code]

The following macros and helper headers are of use to authors whose libraries
include separate source code, and are intended to address several issues:

* Controlling shared library symbol visibility
* Fixing the ABI of the compiled library
* Selecting which compiled library to link against based upon the compilers settings

See [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/Guidelines/Separate Guidelines for Authors of Boost Libraries Containing Separate Source] 

[section Macros controlling shared library symbol visibility]

Some compilers support C++ extensions that control which symbols 
will be exported from shared libraries such as dynamic shared objects (DSO's) on Unix-like
systems or dynamic-link libraries (DLL's) on Windows.

The Microsoft VC++ compiler has long supplied 
`__declspec(dllexport)` and `__declspec(dllimport)` extensions for this purpose,
as do virtually all other compilers targeting the Windows platform.
 
Modern versions of the GNU GCC compiler provide the `__attribute__((visibility("default")))` 
extension to indicate that a symbol should be exported. All other symbols may be hidden by using the
`-fvisibility-hidden` or `-fvisibility-ms-compat` compiler switches.

Boost supplies several macros to make it easier to manage symbol visibility in a way that
is portable between compilers and operating systems.

[table
[[Macro       ][Description       ]]
[[`BOOST_SYMBOL_EXPORT`][
Defines the syntax of a C++ language extension that indicates a symbol is to be exported from a shared library.
If the compiler has no such extension, the macro is defined with no replacement text. 
]]
[[`BOOST_SYMBOL_IMPORT`][
Defines the syntax of a C++ language extension that indicates a symbol is to be imported from a shared library.
If the compiler has no such extension, the macro is defined with no replacement text. 
]]
[[`BOOST_SYMBOL_VISIBLE`][
Defines the syntax of a C++ language extension that indicates a symbol is to be globally visible.
If the compiler has no such extension, the macro is defined with no replacement text. 
Needed for classes that are not otherwise exported, but are used by RTTI. Examples include
class for objects that will be thrown as exceptions or used in dynamic_casts,
across shared library boundaries. For example, a header-only exception class might look like this:
``
  class BOOST_SYMBOL_VISIBLE my_exception : public std::runtime_error { ... };
`` 
Without BOOST_SYMBOL_VISIBLE, it would be impossible to catch my_exception thrown from a shared library
compiled by GCC with the -fvisibility=hidden option.
]]
[[`BOOST_HAS_DECLSPEC`][
The compiler has C++ extensions `__declspec(dllexport)` and `__declspec(dllimport)` to control
export/import of symbols from shared libraries.
['Deprecated. This macro is no longer necessary since BOOST_SYMBOL_EXPORT and BOOST_SYMBOL_IMPORT
are now supplied. It is provided to support legacy code.]
]]
]

Typical usage:

[*boost/foo/config.hpp]

    ...
    #if defined(BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK) || defined(BOOST_FOO_DYN_LINK)
    # if defined(BOOST_FOO_SOURCE)
    #   define BOOST_FOO_DECL BOOST_SYMBOL_EXPORT
    # else 
    #   define BOOST_FOO_DECL BOOST_SYMBOL_IMPORT
    # endif
    #else
    # define BOOST_FOO_DECL
    #endif
    ...
 
[*boost/foo/foo.hpp] 
  
    #include <boost/foo/config.hpp>
    ...
    class BOOST_FOO_DECL bar { ... };
    ...
    void BOOST_FOO_DECL f();
    ...

[*boost/libs/foo/src/foo.cpp] 
   
    #define BOOST_FOO_SOURCE
    #include <boost/foo/foo.hpp>    
    ...
    void BOOST_FOO_DECL f()
    {
      ...
    }
    ...

[section ABI Fixing]

When linking against a pre-compiled library it vital that the ABI used by the
compiler when building the library ['matches exactly] the ABI used by the code
using the library.  In this case ABI means things like the struct packing
arrangement used, the name mangling scheme used, or the size of some types
(enum types for example).  This is separate from things like threading support,
or runtime library variations, which have to be dealt with by build variants.
To put this in perspective there is one compiler (Borland's) that has so many
compiler options that make subtle changes to the ABI, that at least in theory
there 3200 combinations, and that's without considering runtime library
variations. Fortunately these variations can be managed by `#pragma`'s that
tell the compiler what ABI to use for the types declared in your library.
In order to avoid sprinkling `#pragma`'s all over the boost headers, there are
some prefix and suffix headers that do the job. Typical usage is:

[*my_library.hpp]

    #ifndef MY_INCLUDE_GUARD
    #define MY_INCLUDE_GUARD

    // all includes go here:
    ``[^[*#include <boost/config.hpp>]]``
    #include <whatever>

    ``[^[*#include <boost/config/abi_prefix.hpp>]]`` // must be the last #include

    namespace boost {

    // your code goes here

    }

    ``[^[*#include <boost/config/abi_suffix.hpp>]]`` // pops abi_prefix.hpp pragmas

    #endif // include guard

[*my_library.cpp]

    ...
    // nothing special need be done in the implementation file
    ...

The user can disable this mechanism by defining `BOOST_DISABLE_ABI_HEADERS`, or
they can define `BOOST_ABI_PREFIX` and/or `BOOST_ABI_SUFFIX` to point to their
own prefix/suffix headers if they so wish.

[section Automatic library selection]

It is essential that users link to a build of a library which was built against
the same runtime library that their application will be built against -if this
does not happen then the library will not be binary compatible with their own
code- and there is a high likelihood  that their application will experience
runtime crashes.  These kinds of problems can be extremely time consuming and
difficult to debug, and often lead to frustrated users and authors alike (simply
selecting the right library to link against is not as easy as it seems when
their are 6-8 of them to chose from, and some users seem to be blissfully
unaware that there even are different runtimes available to them).

To solve this issue, some compilers allow source code to contain `#pragma`'s that
instruct the linker which library to link against, all the user need do is
include the headers they need, place the compiled libraries in their library
search path, and the compiler and linker do the rest. Boost.config supports
this via the header `<boost/config/auto_link.hpp>`, before including this header
one or more of the following macros need to be defined:

[variablelist
[[`BOOST_LIB_NAME`][
Required: An identifier containing the basename of the library, for
example 'boost_regex'.
]]
[[`BOOST_DYN_LINK`][
Optional: when set link to dll rather than static library.
]]
[[`BOOST_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC`][
Optional: when set the header will print out the name of the library selected
(useful for debugging).
]]
]

If the compiler supports this mechanism, then it will be told to link against
the appropriately named library, the actual algorithm used to mangle the name
of the library is documented inside `<boost/config/auto_link.hpp>` and has to
match that used to create the libraries via bjam 's install rules.


[*my_library.hpp]

    ...
    //
    // Don't include auto-linking code if the user has disabled it by
    // defining BOOST_ALL_NO_LIB, or BOOST_MY_LIBRARY_NO_LIB, or if this 
    // is one of our own source files (signified by BOOST_MY_LIBRARY_SOURCE):
    //
    #if !defined(BOOST_ALL_NO_LIB) && !defined(BOOST_MY_LIBRARY_NO_LIB) && !defined(BOOST_MY_LIBRARY_SOURCE)
    #  define BOOST_LIB_NAME boost_my_library
    #  ifdef BOOST_MY_LIBRARY_DYN_LINK
    #     define BOOST_DYN_LINK
    #  endif
    #  include <boost/config/auto_link.hpp>
    #endif
    ...

[*my_library.cpp]

    // define BOOST_MY_LIBRARY_SOURCE so that the header knows that the
    // library is being built (possibly exporting rather than importing code)
    //
    #define BOOST_MY_LIBRARY_SOURCE

    #include <boost/my_library/my_library.hpp>
    ...
