\page status_of_cpp0x_characters_support Status of C++0x char16_t/char32_t support

The support of C++0x \c char16_t and \c char32_t is experimental, mostly does not work and not
intended to be used in production with current latest compilers: GCC-4.5, MSVC10 till major
compiler's flaws would be fixed.

\section status_of_cpp0x_characters_support_gnu GNU GCC 4.5/C++0x Status

GNU C++ compiler provides decent support of C++0x characters however:

-# 	Standard library does not install any std::locale::facets for this support so any attempt
    to format numbers using \c char16_t or \c char32_t streams would just fail.
-#	Standard library misses specialization for required \c char16_t/char32_t locale facets,
	so "std" backends is not build-able as essential symbols missing, also \c codecvt facet
	can't be created as well.

\section status_of_cpp0x_characters_support_msvc Visual Studio 2010 (MSVC10)/C++0x Status

MSVC provides all required facets however:

-# 	Standard library does not provide installations of std::locale::id for these facets
	in DLL so it is not usable with \c /MD, \c /MDd compiler flags and requires static link of the runtime
	library.
-#	\c char16_t and \c char32_t are not distinct types but rather aliases of unsigned short and unsigned
	types which contradicts to C++0x requirements making it impossible to write \c char16_t/char32_t to stream
	and causing multiple faults.
