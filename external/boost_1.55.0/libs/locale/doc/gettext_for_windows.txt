\page gettext_for_windows  Using Gettext Tools on Windows

In order to get the Gettext tools like \c msgfmt, \c msgmerge, \c xgettext for Windows you have
basically several options:

- Download the package from <a href="http://cppcms.sourceforge.net">CppCMS</a> project (where the Boost.Locale was developed originally)
- Download the a set of packages from MinGW project
- Build it on your own
- Use Cygwin's packages

\section gettext_for_windows_cppcms Getting gettext utilities from CppCMS project

Boost.Locale was developed for needs of <a href="http://cppcms.sourceforge.net">CppCMS</a> project
and thus CppCMS hosts a convince package for Windows users of pre-build, statically liked \c gettext
runtime utilities like \c xgettext, \c msgfmt, etc. 

So you can download a zip file \c gettext-tools-static-XXX.zip from a CppCMS downloads page
under <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cppcms/files/boost_locale/gettext_for_windows/">boost_locale/gettext_for_windows</a>.

Extract the file and use the executable files inside.

\section gettext_for_windows_mingw Getting Gettext via MinGW project

MinGW project provides GNU tools for Windows, including GNU compilers and various runtime utilities.
Thus you can always install full MinGW distribution including gettext tools. However, if you
a want minimalistic runtime version that allows you to extract messages and create catalogs
you need to download several packages manually.

In order to install Gettext via MinGW distributing you need to download, a GCC's runtime, 
iconv library and gettext itself.

So visit a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/">downloads page</a> of MinGW project
and download following files (chose the latest versions of each package):

-   From: \c MinGW/BaseSystem/GCC/Version4/gcc-xxx/ \n
    File: \c libgcc-xxx-mingw32-dll-1.tar.lzma
-   From \c MinGW/Gettext/gettext-yyy/ \n
    Files: \c gettext-yyy-mingw32-dev.tar.lzma,
    \c libgettextpo-yyy-mingw32-dll-0.tar.lzma,
    \c libintl-yyy-mingw32-dll-8.tar.lzma
-   From \c MinGW/libiconv/libiconv-zzz/ \n
    Files: \c libiconv-zzz-mingw32-dll-2.tar.lzma, \c libcharset-zzz-mingw32-dll-1.tar.lzma

For example, at June 23, 2011 it was:

- GNU Runtime: \c libgcc-4.5.2-1-mingw32-dll-1.tar.lzma
- \c iconv: \c libiconv-1.13.1-1-mingw32-dll-2.tar.lzma and \c libcharset-1.13.1-1-mingw32-dll-1.tar.lzma
- \c gettext: \c libintl-0.17-1-mingw32-dll-8.tar.lzma, \c libgettextpo-0.17-1-mingw32-dll-0.tar.lzma and \c gettext-0.17-1-mingw32-dev.tar.lzma.

After you download the packages, extract all the files to the same directory using tools like
\c 7zip and you'll get all the executables and \c dll's you need under \c bin subdirectory.

\note the version on MinGW site is slightly outdated (0.17.1) while gettext provides currently 0.18.1. 

\section gettext_for_windows_build Building latest version on your own. 

You can build your own version of GNU Gettext using MinGW environment, you'll need to have up-to-date gcc compiler
and the shell, you'll need to install iconv first and then build a gettext with it.

Basic and simplest way would be to open a MinGW shell

Build \c iconv:

\code
cd libiconv-SOMEVERSION
./configure --prefix=c:/mygettext --disable-shared
make
make install
cd ..
cd gettext-SOMEVERSION
./configure --prefix=c:/mygettext --disable-shared --with-libiconv-prefix=c:/mygettext
make
make install
\endcode

And now you have in <tt>c:\\mygettext\\bin</tt> all appropriate executable files
to use.

\section gettext_for_windows_cygwin Using Cygwin

If you already have Cygwin - just use gettext tools provided with it.
