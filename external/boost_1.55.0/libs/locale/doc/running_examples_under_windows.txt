\page running_examples_under_windows Running Examples under Microsoft Windows

All of the examples that come with Boost.Locale are designed for UTF-8 and it is
the default encoding used by Boost.Locale.

However, the default narrow encoding under Microsoft Windows is not UTF-8 and 
the output of the applications would not be displayed correctly in the console.

So in order to use UTF-8 encoding under the Windows console and see the output correctly, do the following:

-# Open a \c cmd window
-# Change the default font to a TrueType font: go to properties-\>font (right click on title-bar-\>properties-\>font) and
change the font to a TrueType font like Lucida Console
-# Change the default codepage to 65001 (UTF-8) by running <tt>chcp 65001</tt>

Now all of the examples should display UTF-8 characters correctly (if the font supports them).

<b>Note for Visual Studio users:</b> Microsoft Visual Studio assumes that all source files are encoded using an "ANSI" codepage
like 1252. However all examples use UTF-8 encoding by default, so wide character examples would
not work under MSVC as-is. In order to force it to treat source files as UTF-8 you need to
convert the files to UTF-8 with BOM, which can be done easily by re-saving them from Notepad,
which adds a BOM to UTF-8 files by default.
