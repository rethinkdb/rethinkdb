\page tested_compilers_and_paltforms Tested Compilers and Platforms

Following compilers are tested and known to work with Boost.Locale

- GCC 3.4 to 4.6
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 to 2010
- Intel 10 to 12
- Clang 2.8
- Path Scale 4
- Visual Age 10.1

Following operating systems are tested with Boost.Locale

- Linux
- Windows
- FreeBSD
- Solaris
- Darwin
- Cygwin
- AIX

\section tested_compilers_and_paltforms_issues Known Issues

-   Path Scale and MSVC 9 with STLPort has some test faults
    regarding invalid UTF-8 sequences in wide file I/O.
-   The native iconv library on AIX platform does not support
    required character encodings, thus either ICU or GNU iconv
    library should be used.
-   Mingw/GCC version 4.5 and above is required to support shared
    builds of Boost.Locale - versions that allow dynamic link
    with libstdc++ and libgcc. There is no problems with Cygwin's
    gcc-4.3 that provides shared versions of runtime libraries.
-   In some cases the build system fails to link with iconv library
    on Darwin system, in such cases explicit path to the
    location of iconv library should be given using -sICONV_PATH
    build option.
