In addition to the [link boost_random.reference.generators random number generators],
this library provides distribution functions which map one distribution
(often a uniform distribution provided by some generator) to another.

Usually, there are several possible implementations of any given mapping.
Often, there is a choice between using more space, more invocations of the
underlying source of random numbers, or more time-consuming arithmetic such
as trigonometric functions. This interface description does not mandate any
specific implementation. However, implementations which cannot reach certain
values of the specified distribution or otherwise do not converge
statistically to it are not acceptable.
