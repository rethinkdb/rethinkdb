For some people, performance of random number generation is an important
consideration when choosing a random number generator or a particular
distribution function. This page provides numerous performance tests with
the wide variety of generators and distributions available in the boost
library.

The performance has been evaluated on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7
CPU Q 840 @ 1.87GHz, 1867 Mhz with Visual C++ 2010, Microsoft
Windows 7 Professional and with gcc 4.4.5, Ubuntu Linux 2.6.35-25-generic.
The speed is reported in million random numbers
per second (M rn/sec), generated in a tight loop.

Note that the lagged Fibonacci and ranlux_01 generators produce
floating-point numbers, whereas all others produce integers.
