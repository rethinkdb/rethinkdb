[section:condvar_ref Condition Variables]

[heading Synopsis]

  namespace boost 
  {
    enum class cv_status;
    {
      no_timeout,
      timeout
    };
    class condition_variable;
    class condition_variable_any;
    void notify_all_at_thread_exit(condition_variable& cond, unique_lock<mutex> lk);
  }

The classes `condition_variable` and `condition_variable_any` provide a
mechanism for one thread to wait for notification from another thread that a
particular condition has become true. The general usage pattern is that one
thread locks a mutex and then calls `wait` on an instance of
`condition_variable` or `condition_variable_any`. When the thread is woken from
the wait, then it checks to see if the appropriate condition is now true, and
continues if so. If the condition is not true, then the thread then calls `wait`
again to resume waiting. In the simplest case, this condition is just a boolean
variable:

    boost::condition_variable cond;
    boost::mutex mut;
    bool data_ready;

    void process_data();

    void wait_for_data_to_process()
    {
        boost::unique_lock<boost::mutex> lock(mut);
        while(!data_ready)
        {
            cond.wait(lock);
        }
        process_data();
    }

Notice that the `lock` is passed to `wait`: `wait` will atomically add the
thread to the set of threads waiting on the condition variable, and unlock the
mutex. When the thread is woken, the mutex will be locked again before the call
to `wait` returns. This allows other threads to acquire the mutex in order to
update the shared data, and ensures that the data associated with the condition
is correctly synchronized.

In the mean time, another thread sets the condition to `true`, and then calls
either `notify_one` or `notify_all` on the condition variable to wake one
waiting thread or all the waiting threads respectively.

    void retrieve_data();
    void prepare_data();

    void prepare_data_for_processing()
    {
        retrieve_data();
        prepare_data();
        {
            boost::lock_guard<boost::mutex> lock(mut);
            data_ready=true;
        }
        cond.notify_one();
    }

Note that the same mutex is locked before the shared data is updated, but that
the mutex does not have to be locked across the call to `notify_one`.

This example uses an object of type `condition_variable`, but would work just as
well with an object of type `condition_variable_any`: `condition_variable_any`
is more general, and will work with any kind of lock or mutex, whereas
`condition_variable` requires that the lock passed to `wait` is an instance of
`boost::unique_lock<boost::mutex>`. This enables `condition_variable` to make
optimizations in some cases, based on the knowledge of the mutex type;
`condition_variable_any` typically has a more complex implementation than
`condition_variable`.

[variablelist

[[Requires:] [`lk` is locked by the calling thread and either no other thread is waiting on `cond`, or `lk.mutex()` returns the same value for each of the lock arguments supplied by all concurrently waiting (via `wait`, `wait_for`, or `wait_until`) threads.]]
[[Effects:] [transfers ownership of the lock associated with `lk` into internal storage and schedules `cond` to be notified when the current thread exits, after all objects of thread storage duration associated with the current thread have been destroyed. This notification shall be as if

``
  lk.unlock();
  cond.notify_all();
``

]]

]

[/
[[Synchronization:] [The call to notify_all_at_thread_exit and the completion of the destructors for all the current thread’s variables of thread storage duration synchronize with (1.10) calls to functions waiting on cond.
]]
[[Note:] [The supplied lock will be held until the thread exits, and care must be taken to ensure that this does not cause deadlock due to lock ordering issues. After calling notify_all_at_thread_exit it is recommended that the thread should be exited as soon as possible, and that no blocking or time-consuming tasks are run on that thread.
]]
[[Note:] [It is the user’s responsibility to ensure that waiting threads do not erroneously assume that the thread has finished if they experience spurious wakeups. This typically requires that the condition being waited for is satisfied while holding the lock on lk, and that this lock is not released and reacquired prior to calling notify_all_at_thread_exit.
