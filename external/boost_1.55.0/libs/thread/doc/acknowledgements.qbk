[section:acknowledgements Acknowledgments]

The original implementation of __boost_thread__ was written by William Kempf, with contributions from numerous others. This new
version initially grew out of an attempt to rewrite __boost_thread__ to William Kempf's design with fresh code that could be
released under the Boost Software License. However, as the C++ Standards committee have been actively discussing standardizing a
thread library for C++, this library has evolved to reflect the proposals, whilst retaining as much backwards-compatibility as
possible.

Particular thanks must be given to Roland Schwarz, who contributed a lot of time and code to the original __boost_thread__ library,
and who has been actively involved with the rewrite. The scheme for dividing the platform-specific implementations into separate
directories was devised by Roland, and his input has contributed greatly to improving the quality of the current implementation.

Thanks also must go to Peter Dimov, Howard Hinnant, Alexander Terekhov, Chris Thomasson and others for their comments on the
implementation details of the code.
