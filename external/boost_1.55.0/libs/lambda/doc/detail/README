- lambda_doc.xml is a DocBook xml file from which the lambda docs are
generated
- lambda_doc_chunks.xsl loads the stylesheets that generate a separate
html-file for each section
- lambda_doc.xsl loads stylesheets that generate one big html-file
(you need to edit the paths in these files to make them work)
