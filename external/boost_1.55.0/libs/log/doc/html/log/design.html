<p>
      Boost.Log was designed to be very modular and extensible. It supports both
      narrow-character and wide-character logging. Both narrow and wide-character
      loggers provide similar capabilities, so through most of the documentation
      only the narrow-character interface will be described.
    </p>
<p>
      The library consists of three main layers: the layer of log data collection,
      the layer of processing the collected data and the central hub that interconnects
      the former two layers. The design is presented on the figure below.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/log/Design.png" alt="Design"></span>
    </p>
<p>
      The arrows show the direction of logging information flow - from parts of your
      application, at the left, to the final storage, (if any) at the right. The
      storage is optional because the result of log processing may include some actions
      without actually storing the information anywhere. For example, if your application
      is in a critical state, it can emit a special log record that will be processed
      so that the user sees an error message as a tool-tip notification over the
      application icon in the system tray and hears an alarming sound. This is a
      very important library feature: it is orthogonal to collecting, processing
      logging data and, in fact, what data logging records consist of. This allows
      for use of the library not only for classic logging, but to indicate some important
      events to the application user and accumulate statistical data.
    </p>

      sources</a>
    </h4>
<p>
      Getting back to the figure, in the left side your application emits log records
      with help of loggers - special objects that provide streams to format messages
      that will eventually be put to log. The library provides a number of different
      logger types and you can craft many more yourself, extending the existing ones.
      Loggers are designed as a mixture of distinct features that can be combined
      with each other in any combination. You can simply develop your own feature
      and add it to the soup. You will be able to use the constructed logger just
      like the others - embed it into your application classes or create and use
      a global instance of the logger. Either approach provides its benefits. Embedding
      a logger into some class provides a way to differentiate logs from different
      instances of the class. On the other hand, in functional-style programming
      it is usually more convenient to have a single global logger somewhere and
      have a simple access to it.
    </p>
<p>
      Generally speaking, the library does not require the use of loggers to write
      logs. The more generic term "log source" designates the entity that
      initiates logging by constructing a log record. Other log sources might include
      captured console output of a child application or data received from network.
      However, loggers are the most common kind of log sources.
    </p>
<h4>
<a name="log.design.h1"></a>
      <span class="phrase"><a name="log.design.attributes_and_attribute_values"></a></span><a class="link" href="design.html#log.design.attributes_and_attribute_values">Attributes
      and attribute values</a>
    </h4>
<p>
      In order to initiate logging a log source must pass all data, associated with
      the log record, to the logging core. This data or, more precisely, the logic
      of the data acquisition is represented with a set of named attributes. Each
      attribute is, basically, a function, whose result is called "attribute
      value" and is actually processed on further stages. An example of an attribute
      is a function that returns the current time. Its result - the particular time
      point - is the attribute value.
    </p>
<p>
      There are three kinds of attribute sets:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
          global
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          thread-specific
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          source-specific
        </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
      You can see in the figure that the former two sets are maintained by the logging
      core and thus need not be passed by the log source in order to initiate logging.
      Attributes that participate in the global attribute set are attached to any
      log record ever made. Obviously, thread-specific attributes are attached only
      to the records made from the thread in which they were registered in the set.
      The source-specific attribute set is maintained by the source that initiates
      logging, these attributes are attached only to the records being made through
      that particular source.
    </p>
<p>
      When a source initiates logging, attribute values are acquired from attributes
      of all three attribute sets. These attribute values then form a single set
      of named attribute values, which is processed further. You can add more attribute
      values to the set; these values will only be attached to the particular log
      record and will not be associated with the logging source or logging core.
      As you may notice, it is possible for a same-named attribute to appear in several
      attribute sets. Such conflicts are solved on priority basis: global attributes
      have the least priority, source-specific attributes have the highest; the lower
      priority attributes are discarded from consideration in case of conflicts.
    </p>

<a name="log.design.h2"></a>
      <span class="phrase"><a name="log.design.logging_core_and_filtering"></a></span><a class="link" href="design.html#log.design.logging_core_and_filtering">Logging
      core and filtering</a>
    </h4>
<p>
      When the set of attribute values is composed, the logging core decides if this
      log record is going to be processed in sinks. This is called filtering. There
      are two layers of filtering available: the global filtering is applied first
      within the logging core itself and allows quickly wiping away unneeded log
      records; the sink-specific filtering is applied second, for each sink separately.
      The sink-specific filtering allows directing log records to particular sinks.
      Note that at this point it is not significant which logging source emitted
      the record, the filtering relies solely on the set of attribute values attached
      to the record.
    </p>
<p>
      It must be mentioned that for a given log record filtering is performed only
      once. Obviously, only those attribute values attached to the record before
      filtering starts can participate in filtering. Some attribute values, like
      log record message, are typically attached to the record after the filtering
      is done; such values cannot be used in filters, they can only be used by formatters
      and sinks themselves.
    </p>
<h4>
<a name="log.design.h3"></a>
      <span class="phrase"><a name="log.design.sinks_and_formatting"></a></span><a class="link" href="design.html#log.design.sinks_and_formatting">Sinks
      and formatting</a>
    </h4>
<p>
      If a log record passes filtering for at least one sink the record is considered
      to be consumable. If the sink supports formatted output, this is the point
      when log message formatting takes place. The formatted message along with the
      composed set of attribute values is passed to the sink that accepted the record.
      Note that formatting is performed on the per-sink basis so that each sink can
      output log records in its own specific format.
    </p>
<p>
      As you may have noticed on the figure above, sinks consist of two parts: the
      frontend and the backend. This division is made in order to extract the common
      functionality of sinks, such as filtering, formatting and thread synchronization,
      into separate entities (frontends). Sink frontends are provided by the library,
      most likely users won't have to re-implement them. Backends, on the other hand,
      are one of the most likely places for extending the library. It is sink backends
      that do the actual processing of log records. There can be a sink that stores
      log records into a file; there can be a sink that sends log records over the
      network to the remote log processing node; there can be the aforementioned
      sink that puts record messages into tool-tip notifications - you name it. The
      most commonly used sink backends are already provided by the library.
    </p>
<p>
      Along with the primary facilities described above, the library provides a wide
      variety of auxiliary tools, such as attributes, support for formatters and
      filters, represented as lambda expressions, and even basic helpers for the
      library initialization. You will find their description in the <a class="link" href="detailed.html" title="Detailed features description">Detailed
      features description</a> section. However, for new users it is recommended
      to start discovering the library from the <a class="link" href="tutorial.html" title="Tutorial">Tutorial</a>
      section.
