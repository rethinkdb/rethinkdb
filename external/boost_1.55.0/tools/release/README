Boost SourceForge release folder README
---------------------------------------

The only differences between the distribution files are the line endings
and archive format. The .bz2 and .7z formats are preferred as more compact.  

Distribution files with extensions .gz and .bz2 use Unix line endings.

Distribution files with extensions .zip and .7z use Windows line endings.

See http://www.boost.org/users/history for information about each Boost release.
