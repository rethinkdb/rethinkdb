Description: Build tool 
 Boost.Jam is a portable build tool with its own interpreted language, which 
 allows to implement rather complex logic in a readable way and without 
 resorting to external programs. It is a descendant of Jam/MR tool modified to 
 suit the needs of Boost.Build. In particular, modules and rule parameters
 were added, as well as several new builtins.
