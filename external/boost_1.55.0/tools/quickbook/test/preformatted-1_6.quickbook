Here's the ubiquitous /Hello World/ program in C++.

[pre
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
]

The code should appear as a single block of code in a monospaced font and with
no syntax highlighting. The fifth and sixth lines should appear indented to the
right, aligning under `main`, on line 3.

Here's a one line function definitition: [pre void something(); ].

And some indented code:

[pre
    void go()
    {
    }
]

[endsect]
