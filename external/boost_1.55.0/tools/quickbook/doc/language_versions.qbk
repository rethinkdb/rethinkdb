[section:stable Stable Versions]

Since quickbook 1.3 the `quickbook` attribute in the document block selects
which version of the language to use. Not all changes to quickbook are
implemented using a version switch, it's mainly just the changes that change
the way a document is interpreted or would break existing documentation.

[heading Quickbook 1.3 and later]

* Introduced quickbook language versioning.
* In the documentation info, allow phrase markup in license and purpose
  attributes.
* Fully qualified section and headers. Subsection names are concatenated to the
  ID to avoid clashing. Example: `doc_name.sect_name.sub_sect_name.sub_sub_sect_name`.

[heading Quickbook 1.5 and later]

* Ignore template argument separators inside square brackets.
* Don't separate the final template argument if the `..` separator was
  used. i.e. never mix `..` and whitespace separators.
* Statically scope templates and their arguments rather than dynamically
  scope them.
* Give table ids, and let you set them.
* Allow spaces between the `:` character and ids in elements which can
  have ids.
