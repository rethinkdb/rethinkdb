<p>
          The Boost.Asio library offers side-by-side support for synchronous and
          asynchronous operations. The asynchronous support is based on the Proactor
          design pattern <a class="link" href="async.html#boost_asio.overview.core.async.references">[POSA2]</a>.
          The advantages and disadvantages of this approach, when compared to a synchronous-only
          or Reactor approach, are outlined below.

        </h6>
<p>
          On many platforms, Boost.Asio implements the Proactor design pattern in
          terms of a Reactor, such as <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">select</span></code>,
          <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">epoll</span></code> or <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">kqueue</span></code>. This implementation approach
          corresponds to the Proactor design pattern as follows:
        </p>
<p>
          &#8212; Asynchronous Operation Processor
        </p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

            <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">epoll</span></code> or <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">kqueue</span></code>. When the reactor indicates
            that the resource is ready to perform the operation, the processor executes
            the asynchronous operation and enqueues the associated completion handler
            on the completion event queue.

        </h6>
<p>
          On Windows NT, 2000 and XP, Boost.Asio takes advantage of overlapped I/O
          to provide an efficient implementation of the Proactor design pattern.
          This implementation approach corresponds to the Proactor design pattern
          as follows:
        </p>
<p>
          &#8212; Asynchronous Operation Processor
        </p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
            This is implemented by the operating system. Operations are initiated
            by calling an overlapped function such as <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">AcceptEx</span></code>.
          </p></blockquote></div>
<p>
          &#8212; Completion Event Queue
        </p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
            This is implemented by the operating system, and is associated with an
            I/O completion port. There is one I/O completion port for each <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">io_service</span></code> instance.

          &#8212; Portability.
        </p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
            Many operating systems offer a native asynchronous I/O API (such as overlapped
            I/O on <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows</em></span>) as the preferred option for developing
            high performance network applications. The library may be implemented
            in terms of native asynchronous I/O. However, if native support is not
            available, the library may also be implemented using synchronous event
            demultiplexors that typify the Reactor pattern, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>POSIX</em></span>
            <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">select</span><span class="special">()</span></code>.

          &#8212; Decoupling threading from concurrency.
        </p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
            Long-duration operations are performed asynchronously by the implementation
            on behalf of the application. Consequently applications do not need to
            spawn many threads in order to increase concurrency.
          </p></blockquote></div>
<p>
          &#8212; Performance and scalability.
        </p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
            Implementation strategies such as thread-per-connection (which a synchronous-only
            approach would require) can degrade system performance, due to increased
            context switching, synchronisation and data movement among CPUs. With
            asynchronous operations it is possible to avoid the cost of context switching
            by minimising the number of operating system threads &#8212; typically a limited
            resource &#8212; and only activating the logical threads of control that have
            events to process.
          </p></blockquote></div>
<p>
          &#8212; Simplified application synchronisation.
        </p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
            Asynchronous operation completion handlers can be written as though they
            exist in a single-threaded environment, and so application logic can
            be developed with little or no concern for synchronisation issues.
          </p></blockquote></div>
<p>
          &#8212; Function composition.
        </p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
            Function composition refers to the implementation of functions to provide
            a higher-level operation, such as sending a message in a particular format.
            Each function is implemented in terms of multiple calls to lower-level
            read or write operations.
          </p></blockquote></div>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
            For example, consider a protocol where each message consists of a fixed-length
            header followed by a variable length body, where the length of the body
            is specified in the header. A hypothetical read_message operation could
            be implemented using two lower-level reads, the first to receive the
            header and, once the length is known, the second to receive the body.
          </p></blockquote></div>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
            To compose functions in an asynchronous model, asynchronous operations
            can be chained together. That is, a completion handler for one operation
            can initiate the next. Starting the first call in the chain can be encapsulated
            so that the caller need not be aware that the higher-level operation
            is implemented as a chain of asynchronous operations.
          </p></blockquote></div>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
            The ability to compose new operations in this way simplifies the development
            of higher levels of abstraction above a networking library, such as functions
            to support a specific protocol.

          &#8212; Program complexity.
        </p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
            It is more difficult to develop applications using asynchronous mechanisms
            due to the separation in time and space between operation initiation
            and completion. Applications may also be harder to debug due to the inverted
            flow of control.

<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
            Buffer space must be committed for the duration of a read or write operation,
            which may continue indefinitely, and a separate buffer is required for
            each concurrent operation. The Reactor pattern, on the other hand, does
            not require buffer space until a socket is ready for reading or writing.
