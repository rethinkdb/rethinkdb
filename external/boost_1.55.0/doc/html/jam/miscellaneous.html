        In addition to generic error messages, <code class="literal">b2</code> may emit one
        of the following:

<pre class="programlisting">warning: unknown rule X</pre>
<p>
        A rule was invoked that has not been defined with an "<code class="literal">actions</code>"
        or "<code class="literal">rule</code>" statement.

<p>
        Due to sources not being found, other targets cannot be made.
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">warning: X depends on itself</pre>
<p>
        A target depends on itself either directly or through its sources.

<pre class="programlisting">don't know how to make X</pre>
<p>
        A target is not present and no actions have been defined to create it.
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">X skipped for lack of Y</pre>
<p>
        A source failed to build, and thus a target cannot be built.

<pre class="programlisting">warning: using independent target X</pre>
<p>
        A target that is not a dependency of any other target is being referenced
        with <code class="literal">$(&lt;)</code> or <code class="literal">$(&gt;)</code>.

        For parallel building to be successful, the dependencies among files must
        be properly spelled out, as targets tend to get built in a quickest-first
        ordering. Also, beware of un-parallelizable commands that drop fixed-named
        files into the current directory, like <code class="literal">yacc(1)</code> does.
      </p>
<p>
        A poorly set <code class="literal">$(JAMSHELL)</code> is likely to result in silent
        failure.

        This section is derived from the official Jam documentation and from experience
        using it and reading the Jambase rules. We repeat the information here mostly
        because it is essential to understanding and using Jam, but is not consolidated
        in a single place. Some of it is missing from the official documentation
        altogether. We hope it will be useful to anyone wishing to become familiar
        with Jam and the Boost build system.
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
            Jam "<code class="literal">rules</code>" are actually simple procedural
            entities. Think of them as functions. Arguments are separated by colons.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            A Jam <span class="bold"><strong>target</strong></span> is an abstract entity identified
            by an arbitrary string. The build-in <code class="literal">DEPENDS</code> rule
            creates a link in the dependency graph between the named targets.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            Note that the original Jam documentation for the built-in <code class="literal">INCLUDES</code>
            rule is incorrect: <code class="literal">INCLUDES <span class="emphasis"><em>targets1</em></span> :
            <span class="emphasis"><em>targets2</em></span></code> causes everything that depends
            on a member of <span class="emphasis"><em>targets1</em></span> to depend on all members
            of <span class="emphasis"><em>targets2</em></span>. It does this in an odd way, by tacking
            <span class="emphasis"><em>targets2</em></span> onto a special tail section in the dependency
            list of everything in <span class="emphasis"><em>targets1</em></span>. It seems to be OK
            to create circular dependencies this way; in fact, it appears to be the
            "right thing to do" when a single build action produces both
            <span class="emphasis"><em>targets1</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>targets2</em></span>.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            When a rule is invoked, if there are <code class="literal">actions</code> declared
            with the same name as the rule, the actions are added to the updating
            actions for the target identified by the rule's first argument. It is
            actually possible to invoke an undeclared rule if corresponding actions
            are declared: the rule is treated as empty.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            Targets (other than <code class="literal">NOTFILE</code> targets) are associated
            with paths in the file system through a process called binding. Binding
            is a process of searching for a file with the same name as the target
            (sans grist), based on the settings of the target-specific <code class="literal">SEARCH</code>
            and <code class="literal">LOCATE</code> variables.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            In addition to local and global variables, jam allows you to set a variable
            <code class="literal">on</code> a target. Target-specific variable values can usually
            not be read, and take effect only in the following contexts:
            <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; ">
<li class="listitem">
                  In updating actions, variable values are first looked up <code class="literal">on</code>
                  the target named by the first argument (the target being updated).
                  Because Jam builds its entire dependency tree before executing
                  actions, Jam rules make target-specific variable settings as a
                  way of supplying parameters to the corresponding actions.
                </li>
<li class="listitem">
                  Binding is controlled <span class="emphasis"><em>entirely</em></span> by the target-specific
                  setting of the <code class="literal">SEARCH</code> and <code class="literal">LOCATE</code>
                  variables, as described here.
                </li>
<li class="listitem">
                  In the special rule used for header file scanning, variable values
                  are first looked up <code class="literal">on</code> the target named by the
                  rule's first argument (the source file being scanned).
                </li>
</ul></div>
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            The "bound value" of a variable is the path associated with
            the target named by the variable. In build actions, the first two arguments
            are automatically replaced with their bound values. Target-specific variables
            can be selectively replaced by their bound values using the <code class="literal">bind</code>
            action modifier.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            Note that the term "binding" as used in the Jam documentation
            indicates a phase of processing that includes three sub-phases: <span class="emphasis"><em>binding</em></span>
            (yes!), update determination, and header file scanning. The repetition
            of the term "binding" can lead to some confusion. In particular,
            the Modifying Binding section in the Jam documentation should probably
            be titled "Modifying Update Determination".
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            "Grist" is just a string prefix of the form &lt;<span class="emphasis"><em>characters</em></span>&gt;.
            It is used in Jam to create unique target names based on simpler names.
            For example, the file name "<code class="literal">test.exe</code>" may
            be used by targets in separate subprojects, or for the debug and release
            variants of the "same" abstract target. Each distinct target
            bound to a file called "test.exe" has its own unique grist
            prefix. The Boost build system also takes full advantage of Jam's ability
            to divide strings on grist boundaries, sometimes concatenating multiple
            gristed elements at the beginning of a string. Grist is used instead
            of identifying targets with absolute paths for two reasons:
            <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
                  The location of targets cannot always be derived solely from what
                  the user puts in a Jamfile, but sometimes depends also on the binding
                  process. Some mechanism to distinctly identify targets with the
                  same name is still needed.
                </li>
<li class="listitem">
                  Grist allows us to use a uniform abstract identifier for each built
                  target, regardless of target file location (as allowed by setting
                  ALL_LOCATE_TARGET).
                </li>
</ol></div>
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            When grist is extracted from a name with $(var:G), the result includes
            the leading and trailing angle brackets. When grist is added to a name
            with $(var:G=expr), existing grist is first stripped. Then, if expr is
            non-empty, leading &lt;s and trailing &gt;s are added if necessary to
            form an expression of the form &lt;expr2&gt;; &lt;expr2&gt; is then prepended.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            When Jam is invoked it imports all environment variable settings into
            corresponding Jam variables, followed by all command-line (-s...) variable
            settings. Variables whose name ends in PATH, Path, or path are split
            into string lists on OS-specific path-list separator boundaries (e.g.
            ":" for UNIX and ";" for Windows). All other variables
            are split on space (" ") boundaries. Boost Jam modifies that
            behavior by allowing variables to be quoted.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            A variable whose value is an empty list or which consists entirely of
            empty strings has a negative logical value. Thus, for example, code like
            the following allows a sensible non-empty default which can easily be
            overridden by the user:
<pre class="programlisting"><span class="identifier">MESSAGE</span> <span class="special">?\=</span> <span class="identifier">starting</span> <span class="identifier">jam</span><span class="special">...</span> <span class="special">;</span>
<span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="error">$</span><span class="special">(</span><span class="identifier">MESSAGE</span><span class="special">)</span> <span class="special">{</span> <span class="identifier">ECHO</span> <span class="identifier">The</span> <span class="identifier">message</span> <span class="identifier">is</span><span class="special">:</span> <span class="error">$</span><span class="special">(</span><span class="identifier">MESSAGE</span><span class="special">)</span> <span class="special">;</span> <span class="special">}</span>
</pre>
            If the user wants a specific message, he invokes jam with <code class="literal">"-sMESSAGE=message
            text"</code>. If he wants no message, he invokes jam with <code class="literal">-sMESSAGE=</code>
            and nothing at all is printed.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            The parsing of command line options in Jam can be rather unintuitive,
            with regards to how other Unix programs accept options. There are two
            variants accepted as valid for an option:
            <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
                  <code class="literal">-xvalue</code>, and
                </li>
<li class="listitem">
                  <code class="literal">-x value</code>.
