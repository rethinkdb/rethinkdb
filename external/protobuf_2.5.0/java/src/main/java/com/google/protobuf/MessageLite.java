/**
 * Abstract interface implemented by Protocol Message objects.
 *
 * <p>This interface is implemented by all protocol message objects.  Non-lite
 * messages additionally implement the Message interface, which is a subclass
 * of MessageLite.  Use MessageLite instead when you only need the subset of
 * features which it supports -- namely, nothing that uses descriptors or
 * reflection.  You can instruct the protocol compiler to generate classes
 * which implement only MessageLite, not the full Message interface, by adding
 * the follow line to the .proto file:
 * <pre>
 *   option optimize_for = LITE_RUNTIME;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This is particularly useful on resource-constrained systems where the
 * full protocol buffers runtime library is too big.
 *
 * <p>Note that on non-constrained systems (e.g. servers) when you need to link
 * in lots of protocol definitions, a better way to reduce total code footprint
 * is to use {@code optimize_for = CODE_SIZE}.  This will make the generated
 * code smaller while still supporting all the same features (at the expense of
 * speed).  {@code optimize_for = LITE_RUNTIME} is best when you only have a
 * small number of message types linked into your binary, in which case the
 * size of the protocol buffers runtime itself is the biggest problem.
