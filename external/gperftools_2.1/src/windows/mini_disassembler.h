// This small disassembler is very limited
// in its functionality, and in fact does only the bare minimum required by the
// preamble patching utility.  It may be useful for other purposes, however.
//
// The limitations include at least the following:
//  -# No support for coprocessor opcodes, MMX, etc.
//  -# No machine-readable identification of opcodes or decoding of
//     assembly parameters. The name of the opcode (as a string) is given,
//     however, to aid debugging.
//
// You may ask what this little disassembler actually does, then?  The answer is
// that it does the following, which is exactly what the patching utility needs:
//  -# Indicates if opcode is a jump (any kind) or a return (any kind)
//     because this is important for the patching utility to determine if
//     a function is too short or there are jumps too early in it for it
//     to be preamble patched.
//  -# The opcode length is always calculated, so that the patching utility
//     can figure out where the next instruction starts, and whether it
//     already has enough instructions to replace with the absolute jump
//     to the patching code.
//
// The usage is quite simple; just create a MiniDisassembler and use its
// Disassemble() method.
//
// If you would like to extend this disassembler, please refer to the
// IA-32 Intel® Architecture Software Developer’s Manual Volume 2:
// Instruction Set Reference for information about operand decoding
// etc.
