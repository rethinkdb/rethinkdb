// This .h file imports the code that causes tcmalloc to override libc
// versions of malloc/free/new/delete/etc.  That is, it provides the
// logic that makes it so calls to malloc(10) go through tcmalloc,
// rather than the default (libc) malloc.
//
// This file also provides a method: ReplaceSystemAlloc(), that every
// libc_override_*.h file it #includes is required to provide.  This
// is called when first setting up tcmalloc -- that is, when a global
// constructor in tcmalloc.cc is executed -- to do any initialization
// work that may be required for this OS.  (Note we cannot entirely
// control when tcmalloc is initialized, and the system may do some
// mallocs and frees before this routine is called.)  It may be a
// noop.
//
// Every libc has its own way of doing this, and sometimes the compiler
// matters too, so we have a different file for each libc, and often
// for different compilers and OS's.
