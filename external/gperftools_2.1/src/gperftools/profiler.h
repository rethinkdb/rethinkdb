 * Module for CPU profiling based on periodic pc-sampling.
 *
 * For full(er) information, see doc/cpuprofile.html
 *
 * This module is linked into your program with
 * no slowdown caused by this unless you activate the profiler
 * using one of the following methods:
 *
 *    1. Before starting the program, set the environment variable
 *       "PROFILE" to be the name of the file to which the profile
 *       data should be written.
 *
 *    2. Programmatically, start and stop the profiler using the
 *       routines "ProfilerStart(filename)" and "ProfilerStop()".
 *
 *
 * (Note: if using linux 2.4 or earlier, only the main thread may be
 * profiled.)
 *
 * Use pprof to view the resulting profile output.
 *    % pprof <path_to_executable> <profile_file_name>
 *    % pprof --gv  <path_to_executable> <profile_file_name>
 *
 * These functions are thread-safe.
