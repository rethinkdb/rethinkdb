  // Control operations for getting and setting malloc implementation

  // generic
  // -------
  // "generic.current_allocated_bytes"
  //      Number of bytes currently allocated by application
  //      This property is not writable.
  //
  // "generic.heap_size"
  //      Number of bytes in the heap ==
  //            current_allocated_bytes +
  //            fragmentation +
  //            freed memory regions
  //      This property is not writable.
  //
  // tcmalloc
  // --------
  // "tcmalloc.max_total_thread_cache_bytes"
  //      Upper limit on total number of bytes stored across all
  //      per-thread caches.  Default: 16MB.
  //
  // "tcmalloc.current_total_thread_cache_bytes"
  //      Number of bytes used across all thread caches.
  //      This property is not writable.
  //
  // "tcmalloc.central_cache_free_bytes"
  //      Number of free bytes in the central cache that have been
  //      assigned to size classes. They always count towards virtual
  //      memory usage, and unless the underlying memory is swapped out
  //      by the OS, they also count towards physical memory usage.
  //      This property is not writable.
  //
  // "tcmalloc.transfer_cache_free_bytes"
  //      Number of free bytes that are waiting to be transfered between
  //      the central cache and a thread cache. They always count
  //      towards virtual memory usage, and unless the underlying memory
  //      is swapped out by the OS, they also count towards physical
  //      memory usage. This property is not writable.
  //
  // "tcmalloc.thread_cache_free_bytes"
  //      Number of free bytes in thread caches. They always count
  //      towards virtual memory usage, and unless the underlying memory
  //      is swapped out by the OS, they also count towards physical
  //      memory usage. This property is not writable.
  //
  // "tcmalloc.pageheap_free_bytes"
  //      Number of bytes in free, mapped pages in page heap.  These
  //      bytes can be used to fulfill allocation requests.  They
  //      always count towards virtual memory usage, and unless the
  //      underlying memory is swapped out by the OS, they also count
  //      towards physical memory usage.  This property is not writable.
  //
  // "tcmalloc.pageheap_unmapped_bytes"
  //        Number of bytes in free, unmapped pages in page heap.
  //        These are bytes that have been released back to the OS,
  //        possibly by one of the MallocExtension "Release" calls.
  //        They can be used to fulfill allocation requests, but
  //        typically incur a page fault.  They always count towards
  //        virtual memory usage, and depending on the OS, typically
  //        do not count towards physical memory usage.  This property
  //        is not writable.

  // "tcmalloc.central" - tcmalloc's central free-list. One entry per
  //          size-class is returned. Never unmapped.
