// The OS-specific header included below must provide two calls:

// void SpinLockDelay(volatile Atomic32 *w, int32 value, int loop)

// spin loop on location *w, whose previously observed value was "value".
// SpinLockDelay() may do nothing, may yield the CPU, may sleep a clock tick,
// or may wait for a delay that can be truncated by a call to SpinlockWake(w).
// In all cases, it must return in bounded time even if SpinlockWake() is not
