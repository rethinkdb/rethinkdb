=================


What is RethinkDB?
-----------

* **Open-source** database for building realtime web applications
* **NoSQL** database that stores schemaless JSON documents
* **Distributed** database that is easy to scale
* **High availability** database with automatic failover and robust fault tolerance

RethinkDB is the first open-source scalable database built for realtime applications. It exposes a new database access model -- instead of polling for changes, the developer can tell the database to continuously push updated query results to applications in realtime. RethinkDB allows developers to build scalable realtime apps in a fraction of the time with less effort.
